- Lab 5d- Associate bot in FBM Flow
    * Bot and agent escalation explained
    * Update the FBM Inbound workflow

# Introduction

## Lab Objective
This lab is designed to complete the integration of the QnA bot with the Facebook Messenger channel.

## Pre-requisite
- WxCC Portal, Agent Desktop and IMI connect URL
- Admin credentials to complete configurations in WxCC portal and IMI connect
- Agent Credentials to Handle FBM digital contact
- Basic FBM contact routing should be working
- QnA bot created and live

## Lab 5b - Task Bot Creation

### 1. Bot and agent escalation explained
- Incoming message from customer is set to a variable called `messagetext`

- This message from cusotmer is sent to bot 

- The bot sends `qnabot.text_response` back to the caller

- The outbound message is using the `Append Conversation node`

- We are receiving the message from customer in the `Receive` and replace `messagetext`

- We are appending the incoming message from customer and looping the message to the bot node

- The loop continues until agent escalation is requested by the customer which is when the `onAgentAnswer` event the bot woud trigger 

- After this we queue the task and contact is delivered to agent

### 2. Update the FBM Inbound workflow 
- Login to Connect and open the working FBM Inbound workflow

- Add and configure the following nodes, `QnA Bot` , `Messenger` , `Append Conversation` , `Receive` , `Append Conversation`

- Connect the `Create Task` node to `QnA Bot` node 

- Open `QnA Bot` update the below values and Save
    
    - BOT: Select your bot in this dropdown
    
    - MESSAGE: $(messagetext)
    
    - PS ID: $(n2.messenger.psId)

- Connect the `QnA Bot` (onSucess event) to the new `Messenger` node

- Open `Messenger` node and update the below values and Save

    - MESSAGE TYPE: TEXT
    
    - MESSAGE: $(n955.qnabot.text_response)
        
        - n955 is the node ID of the `QnA Bot` node used in the demo
        
        - This value might might be different in your configuration
        
        - Verify and Use the `QnA Bot` nodeID

- Connect the `Messenger` node to `Append Conversation`

- Open the `Append Conversation` node and update the below values and Save 
    
    - METHOD NAME: Append Chat 
    
    - NODE RUNTIME AUTHORIZATION: Create a new AUTH or add an existing AUTH

        - n955 is the node ID of the `QnA Bot` node used in the demo
        
        - This value might might be different in your configuration
        
        - Verify and Use the `QnA Bot` nodeID
    
    - TIMESTAMP (IN UTC): $(n956.send.sentDateTime)
        
        - n956 is the node ID of the `Messenger` node used in the demo

         - Verify and Use the `Messenger` nodeID
    
    - ATTACHMENTS: $(parseDataAttachment)

- Open the `Receive` node and update the below values and Save 
    
    - Under `Configuration` tab
        
        - Select 'Receive Messenger message/event'
        
        - FROM (PSID): $(n2.messenger.psId)

    - Under `Transition Actions` tab, configure action
        
        - TIME: On-Enter
        
        - ACTION: Set Variable 
        
        - VARIABLE: messagetext
        
        - VALUE: $(n959.receive.message)
            
            - n956 is the node ID of the `Receive` node used in the demo
            
            - This value might might be different in your configuration
            
            - Verify and Use the `Receive` nodeID

- Connect the `Receive` node to `Append Conversation`

- Open the `Append Conversation` node and update the below values and Save
