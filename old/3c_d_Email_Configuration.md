# Introduction

## Lab Objective

This lab is designed to ensure we onboard Email account configuration into WxCC using IMI. You will be able to initiate an email to the Contact Center and be able to accept/respond to the email by logging in as an agent.  

We will be configuring Email Account settings, Email Assets, Entry Point, Queue and corresponding workflows. This helps us connecting the Email account with our application.  

## Pre-requisite

1. An Email account to be used in WxCC.
2. Portal, Agent Desktop and IMI connect URL.
3. Admin credentials to configure in portal and IMI connect.
4. Agent Credentials to Handle the Email.
