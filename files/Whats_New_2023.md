Consent-based recording

Some regions require businesses to inform their callers that the call is being recorded for training and quality assurance. To address this, Webex Contact Center introduces consent-based recording for voice call recordings. This feature seeks caller’s input/consent before continuing to record the voice call. Based on the caller’s consent, the system enables/disables recording of the voice call before the agent starts a conversation with the caller.

June 6, 2023
Callback-retry attempts to customer

A successful callback request will lead to positive customer satisfaction (CSAT) score, while an unsuccessful callback request leads to a negative CSAT score. One of the prime reasons for an unsuccessful callback request is that customers aren’t reachable or busy at callback time.

With this feature, flow designers will now be able to:

Connfigure the callback retries, if the first callback attempt is unsuccessful.

Configure a delay timer between the callback requests.

For more information, see CallbackFailed.

June 6, 2023
Customize ANI for different call scenarios

Automatic Number Identification (ANI) is a feature for telecommunication networks to allow telephone users to identify the contacts being dialed. ANI feature provides the phone call recipient with the caller’s phone number. The technology and method used to provide the information depends on the service provider. There are scenarios where the system sends a default ANI to the call recipient which leads to the customer disconnecting the calls as the number is not identified by them. This feature will help the flow developer define the ANI in Flow Control which can be sent to the service provider. This feature is developed considering the legal scenario to not display any random numbers that are not associated with the contact center.

These scenarios are covered as part of this feature:

Inbound Call

Outbound Call

Transfer/Consult

Courtesy Callback

Preview Outbound Campaign

For more information, see Set Caller ID.

June 6, 2023

Simplified flows to replace old complex digital channel flows

The original flows provided for digital channels integration with Webex Contact Center were somewhat complex. The simplified flows replace the old flows with new and much simpler configurations that help our partners and customers to focus on developing the business logic.

The simplification entails to start a flow with the customary channel specific Incoming Message node, Evaluate node to extract correct fields, followed by Resolve Conversation node that provide clean paths to add business logic for a new interaction.

Old complex flow

New simplified flow

The old complex flows that are currently deployed will continue to work for some time in a deprecated state. Any customer who wishes to deploy new flows will need to add logic to the old shared flows to limit their execution to the old assets only. For more information, see Configure flows for digital channels.

March 24, 2023
Partial Response in Virtual Agent - Voice

The partial response feature addresses a key aspect of the user experience by engaging a user during a call. It plays an interim message while the Webhook response takes time to process in the background.

For an AI application (Dialogflow CX) that requires multiple parameters, an API or Webhook request typically takes longer to receive the correct response. During the processing of an API request, an end user is kept completely silent. There is a possibility of the end-user hanging up the call. To prevent this, an interim response must be issued to inform the end customer that their request is still being processed.

This feature enables an AI bot developer to construct a static response that can be communicated back to the end user while their query is still in progress. In the CX bot agent, static messages can be configured for up to 30 seconds. Once the final API response is received, the flow can be continued.

This feature is supported only for the US data center deployment on the Next Generation platform.

For more information, see the Supported Integration section in the Virtual Agent–Voice (VAV) in Webex Contact Center article.

March 21, 2023

February 26, 2023
Regional media support extended to additional regions

Webex Contact Center now extends support for regional media to London, Frankfurt, Mumbai and Singapore data centers. Regional media allows customer and agent media (audio and SIP signaling) to remain local to a geographic region regardless of where the Webex Contact Center tenant or home location resides. Keeping the media local to a region decreases latency, improves audio quality, and provides unique regionalized configurations for multinational deployments.

For example, if a Webex Contact Center tenant is located in the US region, US calls are hosted in the US, European calls in Europe and Asian calls in Asia. Only control signaling is sent from the media region to the business logic of the contact center in the US.

Regional media is available to customers using Webex Contact Centers that are provisioned with the Next Generation platform media handling.

February 22, 2023
Increased Contact limit for Address Book

February 7, 2023
Enhance scheduling experience using Business Hours

Business Hours enables administrators to configure working and nonworking hours for your organization specific to your timezone.

With this enhancement, administrators or flow developers can select the Static ANI number (from the dropdown list of available Entry Point-Dial Numbers) or Variable ANI (variable defined as a valid E.164 number, with a valid Entry Point-Dial Number mapping) in the Courtesy Callback activity in Flow Designer.

For more information, see Callback.

January 25, 2023
Optimize flows with error handling paths

Flow designer brings in a mechanism to configure error handling paths to optimize the flow. This feature enables an error exit for every activity so that the failures can be handled gracefully as desired by the flow developer. Flow Designer informs the flow developers about the system and activity errors that occurred while configuring activities. If the flow encounters any errors other than these predefined errors, the flow takes the path defined in the Undefined Error node of that activity. This error node sets the error output path that the flow takes when there are undefined system errors during flow execution. Moreover, if there’s no error handling path configured for the activity, the flow uses the default path that is configured in the OnGlobalError event handler in the Event Flows tab. For more information, see Error Handling.

Regional Media support through Real Time Media Service (RTMS) voice platform

Webex Contact Center supports regional media availability via RTMS. This feature allows customer media (audio and SIP signaling) to remain local in a geographic region regardless of where the Webex Contact Center tenant or its home location resides. Keeping the media local to a region decreases latency, improves audio quality, and provides unique regionalized media configurations for multi-national deployments. For example, the Webex Contact Center tenant is defined as a home region in the United States. When an inbound call arrives in a non-home region such as Sydney, Australia, the media services remain local to the Sydney, Australia region with only application control signalling backhauled to the United States home region. This feature is available for supported RTMS regions such as USA and Sydney with additional regions coming online in late 2022.

For more information, see Map an Entry Point.

03 November 2022
Webex Contact Center launch in Japan data center

Webex Contact Center services are now available from a new Japan-based data center.

Surge Protection: Maximum concurrent digital contacts for a tenant

This feature defines the maximum number of digital contacts that can be active on the customer tenant. The Maximum Concurrent Digital Contact Threshold indicates this value. When the tenant reaches the threshold, it rejects any new digital contacts until existing digital contacts disconnect to bring down the number of concurrent digital contacts below the threshold. The concurrent digital contacts in the contact center include Chat, Email, SMS, and Social Channels.

This feature is applicable for customers using Webex Connect.

The value of Maximum Concurrent Digital Contact Threshold is set to 30% higher than the concurrent digital contact entitlements:

Maximum Concurrent Digital Contact Threshold = Concurrent Digital Contact Entitlements \* 1.3
The value of concurrent digital contact entitlements is based on the following formula:

Concurrent Digital Contact Entitlements = (Number of committed Standard Agent licenses + Number of committed Premium Agent licenses) x 2 x 15

For zero commitment orders, the default value of concurrent digital contact entitlements is:

100 x 15
Customers can raise a support request to adjust the Maximum Concurrent Digital Contact Threshold for your tenant. The maximum concurrent digital contact threshold cannot exceed 160,000.

For more information, see Concurrent Digital Contact Settings in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

The Surge Protection Statistics report is available in the Analyzer. For more information, see Surge Protection Statistics in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Analyzer User Guide.

For more information, see the article Bulk Operations in Webex Contact Center.

15 February 2022
Surge Protection: Maximum Concurrent Voice Calls for a Tenant

This feature defines the maximum number of calls that can be active on the customer tenant. The value is termed as Maximum Concurrent Voice Contact Threshold and can be accessed on the Settings tab of the Management Portal. After the threshold is reached, any new calls are rejected until existing calls disconnect, to retain the number of concurrent calls below the threshold. The concurrent calls in the contact center include inbound calls and outdial calls (outdial calls made by agents, outbound campaign calls, and callbacks).

The value of Maximum Concurrent Voice Contact Threshold is set to 30% higher than the Concurrent Voice Contact Entitlements:

Maximum Concurrent Voice Contact Threshold = Concurrent Voice Contact Entitlements \* 1.3
The value of Concurrent Voice Contact Entitlements is based on the following formula:

Concurrent Voice Contact Entitlements = [((Number of committed Standard Agent licenses + Number of committed Premium Agent licenses) * 3) + Number of IVR Add on licenses purchased]

For zero commitment subscription, the value of Concurrent Voice Contact Entitlements is:

Concurrent Voice Contact Entitlements = [100 + Number of IVR Add on licenses purchased]
Customers can raise a support request to decrease or increase the Maximum Concurrent Voice Contact Threshold. The maximum value allowed for concurrent voice contact threshold is 13000. For more information, see Concurrent Voice Contact Settings in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

The Surge Protection Statistics report is introduced in the Analyzer. For more information, see Surge Protection Statistics in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Analyzer User Guide.

Skills-based Routing Enhancement

A new method of contact selection—Skills-based Contact Selection—is introduced in Skills-based Routing (SBR). Customers can opt for one of the following methods to select contacts—Skills-based Contact Selection or First In, First Out (FIFO) based selection. In Skills-based Contact Selection, SBR filters contacts in a queue periodically to match the agent skills in the sequence—(1) contact priority and (2) timestamp (oldest to newest).

Contacts that are sent to SBR queues are parked until a matching agent is available. When an agent is available, the matching contact among the parked contacts connects to the agent on priority, irrespective of the contact's position in the queue. The Skills-based Contact Selection method thus reduces the wait time of parked contacts and improves the productivity of agents.

By default, Skills-based Contact Selection is enabled for customers. To enable FIFO based contact selection, customers must contact Cisco Support. For more information, see Skills-based Contact Selection in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

11 February 2022
Agent Desktop Enhancement - Reorder Icons on the Horizontal Header

A new property headerActions is added to the desktop layout JSON file. This property allows the administrator to change the default order of the icons on the horizontal header of the Agent Desktop—the (1) (Webex), (2) (Outdial), and (3) (Notification Center) icons.

headerActions: ["webex", "outdial", "notification"],
The headerActions property value is case sensitive.

To remove the header icons and their associated functionality from the Agent Desktop, the administrator must remove the property values.

For more information, see headerActions in the Provisioning chapter of the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

Date Format Options for Interval Field in Analyzer Reports

The default date format for the Interval field in the Analyzer reports is mm/dd/yyyy. With the new enhancement, the Analyzer allows users to choose different date formats for the Interval field, similar to other fields in the reports.

Customization of date format was available for profile variables only, previously.

For more information, see Change Date Format of the Interval Field in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Analyzer User Guide.

10 February 2022
Handle Invalid DTMF Input in IVR Post-call Surveys

Webex Contact Center can handle scenarios where there is invalid or no DTMF (dual-tone multifrequency) input response from customers during IVR post-call surveys. Flow developers can configure the Timeout parameter in the Advanced Settings section of the Feedback activity in the Flow Designer to define the maximum duration (in seconds) for which the system waits for DTMF input from customers. Further, administrators can configure the following IVR settings for Webex Contact Center, in the Questionnaire Settings tab of the post-call survey questionnaire in Webex Experience Management:

Maximum Invalid Inputs and Timeout Allowed: Administrators can select a value in the Maximum invalid inputs and timeout allowed drop-down list to set the maximum number of times for which the system allows invalid input or no-input responses from customers.

Audio Files for Notification Messages: Administrators can upload audio files to play notification messages for invalid input, DTMF entry timeout, and maximum number of retries exceeded, respectively.

If a customer enters an invalid input or does not enter any input to a survey question within the specified timeout period, the contact center plays the audio message to notify the customer of the invalid entry or timeout, and then plays the same survey question to the customer. When the maximum number of attempts elapse, the contact center plays the corresponding audio notification to the customer, skips the remaining questions in the survey, and plays the Thank You message to end the survey.

For more information, see Validate DTMF Input Response in IVR Post-call Survey in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

07 February 2022
Global Variables in Webex Contact Center

Administrators can define global variables using the Provisioning module in the Management Portal. Administrators can set the global variables as agent-viewable and agent-editable in order to make them available to agents via the Agent Desktop. Additionally, administrators can set the variables as reportable to include them in Analyzer reports. Flow developers can use the global variables within flows to set and pass values in the context of interactions handled in the contact center. If an agent updates an agent-editable global variable value, the updated value will be available in the Analyzer for reporting. This feature enables administrators to define reportable global variables and persist them across Webex Contact Center components.

For more information, see Global Variables in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

Flow developers can no longer create Call-Associated Data (CAD) variables using the Flow Designer. Custom flow variables will remain non-reportable.

Retain Dashboard Filters in APS and Management Portal
Webex Contact Center stores the filters that are set in each tab of the Agent Performance Statistics (APS) in the Agent Desktop and the Management Portal, in the browser cache. Caching the filters in each tab saves the time taken by agents to set filters every time they change tabs, thereby providing them a better user experience.

The filter changes made by a user are stored in the browser cache of the user's computer for the specific user ID. The filters that the user sets remain the same even if the user refreshes the browser or logs back in to Webex Contact Center using the same browser. The user can reset the filters to the default values by clearing the browser cache.

For more information, see Summary Report, Agent Stats - Historic report, and Agent Stats By State - Historic report in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Agent Desktop User Guide.

This enhancement is applicable for the Agent Desktop and Management Portal, but not for the Analyzer reports.

Retain Column Width in Tabular Reports

Analyzer users can change the column width in tabular reports dynamically when running reports. However, the changed column width was not retained previously when the reports were refreshed, making it necessary for users to resize the columns again.

With the new enhancement, Webex Contact Center stores the changed column width in the browser cache of the user's computer, for the specific user ID. The changed column width remains the same even if the user refreshes the browser or logs out and logs back in to Webex Contact Center using the same browser. The user can reset the column width to the default size by clearing the browser cache, if required.

For more information, see Change Report Column Width in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Analyzer User Guide.

This enhancement is not applicable for the Threshold Alerts section.

Whole Number Format for Contacts Handled

Tabular reports in the Analyzer are enhanced to display the number of contacts that are handled, in the whole number format. This is applicable to the following columns:

Contacts Handled

Inbound Contacts Handled

Outdial Contacts Handled

The reports displayed the data in the decimal format previously.

15 December 2021
Agent Desktop Enhancements

Retain Data for Current Agent Task: A new property stopNavigateOnAcceptTask is added to the desktop layout JSON file. This property determines whether to shift the focus to a newly accepted task or not, when an agent accepts the new task. Administrators can set the property to True or False.

True: Retains the focus on the current task that the agent is working on. This helps to retain unsaved data that is being entered for the current task.

False: Shifts the focus to the newly accepted task. This is the default value.

For more information, see JSON Layout Top-Level Properties in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

Support Special Characters in Dial Number for Calls: Agent Desktop supports the special characters # (hash), \* (asterisk), and : (colon) in addition to + (plus) in the dial number for outdial calls, transfer requests, and consult requests.

When an agent copies a number with special characters to the Dial Number field or dialpad, the Agent Desktop retains only those special characters that are supported (+, #, \*, and :).

For more information, see Manage Voice Calls in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

User Experience Enhancement - Incoming Call Popover Labels: New labels appear on incoming call popovers for easy identification of the call type. The labels also improve accessibility for vision-impaired users.

Additionally, the Agent Desktop displays and as the Callback and Campaign Call icons respectively.

The following table lists the call types, icons, and the corresponding labels:

Call Type

Localization Support Additions in Analyzer

The Analyzer supports localization in two more languages—English (UK) and Portuguese (Portugal), in addition to the 27 languages that were previously supported.

30 November 2021
Support Multiple Languages for Post-call Surveys

Contact center customers can provide feedback via post-call surveys powered by Webex Experience Management in multiple languages. This feature is available for both Voice and Email/SMS survey channels.

To select a custom language for a post-call survey, the flow developer can use the Global_language variable or select the Override Language Settings toggle button in the Language Settings section of the Feedback activity in Flow Designer. If the selected language is not configured in the survey in Webex Experience Management or is not supported, the survey falls back to use the default language English (US).

For more information about the supported languages and how to configure a custom language, see Language Settings in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

For existing flows, enabling the Override Language Settings feature resets the language for all Voice and Email/SMS surveys to English (US). Customers must modify any existing flows (by enabling the Override Language Settings toggle button and then selecting the custom language) to continue using a custom language.

The Preferred Language and Set to Variable parameters are removed from the Feedback activity.

Support Welcome and Thank You Messages in Post-call Surveys

Administrators can configure survey questionnaires to play Welcome and Thank You messages at the beginning and end of IVR post-call surveys. To enable these messages in a survey, the administrator must add corresponding audio files in the Welcome note and Thank You note when configuring the survey questionnaire in Webex Experience Management. These messages use the language setting that is configured in the Feedback activity in the Flow Designer.

The Welcome and Thank You messages are played in the same language as set in the Flow Designer for the survey and selected by the customer. If these messages are not configured and therefore not available in the set language in the survey questionnaire, the contact center skips the messages and plays only the survey questions without the messages.

Support Variables for Custom Prefills in Post-call Surveys

Webex Contact Center supports additional data (for example, Customer Name: John, Country: US) in the form of optional variables. The additional data can be passed to Webex Experience Management, to be stored as part of survey response data.

To enable Webex Contact Center to pass additional data to Webex Experience Management, the administrator must create custom prefill questions in the survey questionnaire in Webex Experience Management. Further, the flow developer must configure corresponding variables as Key-Value pairs in the Feedback activity in the Flow Designer. The flow developer must enter the Display Name of the question in the survey questionnaire in Webex Experience Management as the Key parameter of the corresponding variable in the Feedback activity in the Flow Designer.

Webex Contact Center then passes the additional data to Webex Experience Management, which will be stored as part of the survey response data along with the customer responses. This process makes survey responses more contextual and helps to gain deeper data insights using the Customer Experience Analytics widget.

For more information, see Variable Passing in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

22 November 2021
New Digital Channels in Webex Contact Center in APJC Region

New digital channels–Chat, Email, Short Messaging Service (SMS), and Facebook Messenger–are now available in Webex Contact Center in the APJC region via imimobile integration.

Customers, when using these channels, can use the following enhancements:

Flow Builder: This enhancement empowers customers to create powerful self-help. Flow Builder is an editor that enables customers to create interactive communication flows with minimal programming or scripting efforts. It has an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface called Flow Canvas, which helps to build communication flows using Nodes.

Bot Builder: Using Bot Builder, customers can create a QnA or Task bot, and integrate it via a Flow.

The following features are newly supported:

Skills-Based Routing: Administrators can assign skill requirements as well as skill relaxation criteria to contacts in the QueueTask node in the Flow Builder. Contacts are routed to agents based on skill requirements that are matched best at that point in time in the flow.

Screen Pop: A screen pop is a window that autonomously appears in an agent’s desktop upon certain actions such as accepting the contact, when the agent responds to a contact request from a customer. Screen pops help the agent to get more information about the customer to proceed further with the conversation.

The channel-specific capabilities allow hyperlinks and delivery receipts.

All digital channels are part of the Premium Seat License. Charges are extra for the following services–automated interaction messages, short code SMS, long code SMS, toll-free SMS, and bot usage.

For more information, see New Digital Channels in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

Note: The new digital channels are released in controlled GA (General Availability). Only those customers who have worked with the Cisco Solution Assurance team to plan their onboarding can avail the new digital channels. Migration from select older platforms is also supported. See the article Upgrade from Cisco Webex Contact Center 1.0 to Cisco Webex Contact Center for more information.

11 November 2021
Enable Virtual Agent for Voice to Handle No User Input

Virtual Agents for Voice can handle scenarios where there is no input (voice and DTMF) from the user within a specified time period. Flow developers can set the no-input timeout duration and the number of retries to be made if there is no user input, by specifying the following parameter values in the Advanced Settings of the Virtual Agent activity:

No-Input Timeout: The duration (in seconds) for which the Virtual Agent waits for user input.

Max No-Input Attempts: The number of times the Virtual Agent attempts to wait for user input after the timeout period elapses.

The Virtual Agent activity provides a new output variable ErrorCode to indicate the timeout event or error status.

The default error message that is currently played in English (US) will no longer be played to the users. To play an audio message to notify the users of an error, flow developers will need to include a Play Message activity in the flow that uses the output variable ErrorCode from the Virtual Agent activity.

For more information, see Virtual Agent in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

26 October 2021

Dial Number (US Format)

Extension

If the administrator restricts the DN to the default DN for an agent (Provisioning > Agent Profile > Agent DN Validation > Provisioned Value), the agent cannot edit the prepopulated DN while signing in to the Agent Desktop. The DN will be read-only.

For more information, see the Sign In to the Agent Desktop section in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Agent Desktop User Guide.

Configure Persistent Tabs in Custom Pages and Widgets

An administrator can configure tabs in custom pages and custom widgets as persistent by using the Desktop Layout. To configure persistent tabs, an administrator must set the following attributes for md-tabs:

Set persist-selection to true.

Set a unique identifier for tabs-id.

Example:

{
"comp": "md-tabs",
"attributes": {
"persist-selection": true,
"tabs-id": "unique-id for all the tabs together in the container"
},
}
When md-tabs is set to be persistent ("persist-selection": true), the tab selection is retained even if an agent switches between pages or widgets in the Agent Desktop.

The Auxiliary Information pane and the Agent Performance Statistics reports page in the Agent Desktop already show persistent tab behavior.

For more information, see the Navigation (Custom Pages) section in the Cisco Webex Contact Center Setup and Administration Guide.

Persistent Tabs in Agent Performance Statistics (APS) Reports

User Experience Enhancement:

The media channel badge in the Channel Capacity section of the User Profile dialog box highlights only the relevant media channels for which the agent has capacity allocated.

02 June 2021
Allow Customers to Configure a Mix of Toll and Toll-free Numbers for Cisco PSTN for Contact Center

Prior to this enhancement, if a customer purchased the Bundle 2: Inbound toll-free number access option with the Cisco PSTN for Contact Center add-on, the customer had to configure all inbound numbers as toll-free. For billing, Webex Contact Center considered all dialed numbers as toll-free.

With this enhancement, Webex Contact Center can classify each number added to the tenant as toll or toll-free. Webex Contact Center billing is calculated based on call volumes on all toll-free numbers.

The following license usage reports are enhanced to help classify toll and toll-free numbers:

License Usage Report: This report is enhanced to provide customers a metrics of the daily observed Max Concurrent Toll-Free Calls. This is indicative of the usage of Bundle 2: Inbound toll-free number access. A breakup of the Max Concurrent Toll-Free Calls shows the composition of the calls connected to the Agent, IVR system, and Queue when the maximum value was observed. Additionally, the report provides the concurrent call volumes observed on tolled numbers at the time when Max Concurrent Toll-Free Calls was observed. A breakup of Concurrent Tolled Calls shows the composition of the calls connected to the Agent, IVR system, and Queue.

Historical License Usage Report: This report shows the Max Concurrent Toll-Free Calls for the previous months. This report can access data from the past thirty-six months and can display data for a consecutive twelve-month period.

01 June 2021
Agent Desktop Enhancements
Default Title: The new default title of the Agent Desktop is Webex Contact Center. The administrator can customize the default title at the global level or team level via the Desktop Layout.

User Experience Enhancements:

The Station Login dialog supports the browser Autocomplete feature. Autocomplete saves the agent's time by automatically filling in the previously entered dial number(s) and extension number(s). The number of entries saved in the standard browsing mode is specific to the browser. To remove the saved entries, the agent must clear the browser cache. The Autocomplete feature is not supported in private browsing mode.

The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog now has a minimum height and width (in pixels), beyond which you cannot resize the dialog. This ensures that the content within the dialog remains readable.

The Auxiliary Information pane retains the agent's tab selection for a specific interaction even when the agent switches between interactions. For example, consider that the agent is on a voice interaction and has accessed the Screen Pop tab in the Auxiliary Information pane. The agent then switches to a chat interaction and accesses the Contact History tab. When the agent returns to the voice interaction, the Screen Pop tab selection is retained.

24 May 2021
Filters in the Run Mode

The Analyzer UI offers filtering capabilities when users execute reports in the run mode. This feature provides an enhanced report generation experience. Users can choose the filters to be displayed when they create or edit a visualization, or when they create a copy of the visualization. When the users run the visualization, the selected filters appear at the top-right corner of the visualization page. Users can filter the visualization using the appropriate filters, without having to edit the report.

28 April 2021
Service Details in Control Hub

A new Service Details section is introduced in the Contact Center Settings tab in Control Hub. This section enables administrators and support engineers to quickly identify the platform-level configurations that are applicable to the customer organization. The Service Details section provides the following information:

Webex Contact Center Country of Operation: This field displays the country of operation that was selected in the Setup Wizard when the contact center tenant was provisioned. The field provides an indication of the geolocation of the tenant.

Webex Contact Center Platform Details: The value New Platform displayed in this field confirms that the tenant is hosted on the latest Webex Contact Center platform.

Digital Channel: The value Native Digital displayed in this field confirms that the tenant is using the current Digital Channel offering from Cisco. Additional values will be introduced for this field, as more contact center digital channel offerings are introduced in the future. This will help differentiate customers who use the Native Digital channel from those customers who will be using the upcoming digital channel offerings.

Voice Channel: The value Webex Calling Integrated displayed in this field confirms that the tenant is using Webex Calling integration for telephony. Future enhancements to the contact center voice platform will introduce additional values for this field. This will help differentiate customers who use the Webex Calling Integrated platform from those customers who will be using the upcoming voice platform enhancements.

Webex Contact Center Telephony: This field displays Webex Contact Center PSTN, Webex Calling (CCP and Local gateway), or Voice POP Bridge to indicate the PSTN option that is applicable to the customer.

Agent Desktop Enhancements

Availability State Search: An agent can use the search field to search for the availability state to be displayed on the horizontal header of the Agent Desktop. The availability states are Available, and the idle states configured by the administrator.

Task List Pane Options: The Task List pane in the Agent Desktop provides the following options:

Accept All Tasks: The agent can click the Accept All Tasks button to accept multiple digital channel requests (chat, email, and social messaging conversations) at the same time.

New Replies: The agent can click the New Replies button to scroll to view unread digital channel messages (chat or social messaging conversations).

Special Character Supported for Dial Number and Extension: If an agent copies a Dial Number or Extension that contains special characters (!, @, #, $, %, ^, &, \*, ), (, =, ., <, >, {, }, [, ], :, ;, ', ", |, ~, `, \_, and -) to the Dial Number or the Extension text box, the special characters are removed when submitting the details. This is relevant for the following dialog boxes:

Station Login (Dial Number and Extension)

Transfer Request (Dial Number)

Consult Request (Dial Number)

The only supported special character is +.

Desktop Layout JSON File Properties:

responsive: A new property named responsive is added to the JSON file. This property determines whether a web component or an iFrame-based widget added in the custom layout at the page level or the comp level is responsive or not. This property can be configured with one of the following values:

True: Enables responsiveness of the widget. By default, all widgets are expected to be responsive based on the progressive screen sizes, orientation, and viewing areas of the device being used.

False: Disables responsiveness of the widget. If the widgets do not support viewing on different devices, mark them as non-responsive.

visibility: The visibility property value NOT_RESPONSIVE is deprecated, and you can continue to use it only for backward compatibility. Any value set as NOT_RESPONSIVE previously does not require modification, because the functionality remains the same. To set a newly created widget as responsive or not responsive, use the responsive property.

Flow Chaining

The GoTo activity is introduced in Flow Control to terminate a current flow and hand off the voice call to an entry point or to another flow. Flow to entry point, and flow to flow are voice call handoff mechanisms to redirect calls based on business hours and during emergency conditions.

25 March 2021
Call Prioritization
Call Prioritization enables flow designers to assign priority to inbound calls in a queue. Flow designers can use the Queue Contact activity to assign a priority to a call. When an agent services multiple queues, the call with the highest priority across all queues is assigned to the agent. If two or more calls across multiple queues have the same (highest) priority, the call waiting for the longest duration is assigned first to the agent.

09 March 2021
Agent Desktop Enhancements
Logo and Title Enhancements: The Agent Desktop now supports larger logos. The administrator can configure a logo comprising a larger image of up to 96 x 32 pixels (width x height). The Agent Desktop title can be an image or text. The logo and title together on the horizontal header of the Agent Desktop cannot exceed the maximum width of 304 pixels.

Refresh Data in Transfer Request and Consult Request Dialogs: The Refresh icon in the Transfer Request and Consult Request dialogs in the Agent Desktop enables agents to retrieve the most recent list of agents, queues, or dial numbers.

Sub-layout Feature: The Sub-layout feature enables an administrator to define nested desktop layouts using the Agent Desktop JSON layout file. The Sub-layout feature provides finer control over the widget placement and resize behavior.

Agent Transfer to an Entry Point: Prior to this enhancement, if an agent was on a call with a customer on a workflow, the agent could transfer the call to another agent in the same workflow. But it was not possible for the agent to transfer the call to a different entry point associated with another workflow.

With this enhancement, the agent can transfer the call to a different entry point associated with another workflow. All Call Associated Data (CAD) variables related to the first flow are carried forward to the new workflow.

For example, if a customer is waiting in a queue that is related to debit card transactions, but intends to transact on credit cards, the agent servicing the customer can now transfer the call to the credit card workflow.

08 March 2021
Download Call Recordings

Administrators and Supervisors can download recordings of calls that were handled by Agents. A new API will be available to enable downloading of the recordings.

February 2021
New Cloud Data Platform Providing Historical and Real-time Data
A new Cloud Data Platform is available for Webex Contact Center. The Cloud Data Platform is a big data stream processing platform, which offers increased throughput. The platform provides high data availability, processing real-time call and agent data in 3 to 5 seconds, and historical data within 30 minutes from the time of occurrence of an event. The Cloud Data Platform offers a secure data platform across all channels supported by Webex Contact Center. The platform provides reliable data across real-time and historical reports, ensuring data integrity.

Analyzer connects to the Cloud Data Platform to provide historical and real-time reports.

Global Routing Overrides

A Global Routing Override is a routing strategy that can be applied to one or more entry points. When a contact arrives, the routing engine checks whether a Global Routing Override exists for that entry point. If a Global Routing Override exists, it is then used as the current routing strategy for the entry point, overriding any standard routing strategy associated with that entry point.

Enhancements to Chat and Virtual Agent Template Creation

The user experience on Control Hub for creating and editing Chat and Virtual Agent templates is enhanced to support certain platform upgrades. There is no change to the features provided by the templates.

January 2021
Skills Based Routing

Skills Based Routing is a feature that matches the needs of callers with agents who have the skills to best meet those needs. When voice calls arrive, they are classified into subsets that can be routed only to agents who possess a required set of skills, such as language fluency or product expertise.

Webex Contact Center administrators can now assign skill requirements as well as skill relaxation criteria to calls in the flow. Calls are routed to agents based on skill requirements that are matched best at that point in time in the flow.

Flow Control Usability Enhancements
The Flow Control user experience is enhanced to support the following:

The Flow Control now ensures that the users always enter a unique flow name.

The Flow Control publishing experience is enhanced. The following functionality is available in the Flow Control UI after the user validates a flow and clicks the Publish Flow button:

If publishing fails, a Toaster Notification is displayed with the Tracking ID and Flow ID. The Tracking ID information can be sent to Cisco support for further assistance. The user can click the Retry Publish button to try again.

If publishing succeeds, the user is redirected to a confirmation screen, and will no longer be in the Flow Control UI.

The Global Properties button is included in the zoom toolbar to enable users to quickly open the Global Properties pane. The Global Properties pane appears by default on the Flow Control canvas when a new flow is created or an existing flow is opened.

December 2020
Blended Multimedia Profiles

Blended Multimedia Profiles offer administrators the ability to configure the media channel types (voice, chat, email, and social) and the number of contacts of each media channel that an agent can handle simultaneously. This feature enables the contact center to balance the load efficiently across media channels, and also provide dedicated attention to customers, improving the customer experience.

Administrators can configure multimedia profiles of the following types:

Blended: The administrator can select the media channels and the number of contacts per media channel that the agent can handle simultaneously. The administrator can set up to a maximum of one voice, five chat, five email, and five social contacts for an agent to handle simultaneously.

Blended Real-time: Contacts of only one real-time media channel (either voice or chat) can be assigned to the agent at a point in time, along with contacts of other media channel types (email and social). The maximum number of contacts that an agent can handle simultaneously is one voice (default value), five chat, five email, and five social, with either voice or chat assigned to the agent at a point in time.

Exclusive: Only one contact can be assigned to the agent across all media channels, at a point in time.

The administrator can then associate the multimedia profile to agents at the site, team, or agent level. The multimedia profile set for a team (via Provisioning in the Management Portal) takes precedence over the multimedia profile set for the site; the multimedia profile set for an agent takes precedence over the multimedia profile set for the team.

Supervisory Capability to Sign Out Agents

Supervisors can view the list of agents who are currently signed in to the Agent Desktop, using a new dashboard Agent State Data – Realtime in the Management Portal. The dashboard provides supervisors the ability to sign out agents who are not handling any active contacts; that is, agents who are in the Available or Idle state across all media channels. This feature helps enterprises manage concurrent licensing costs.

Flow Designer

An all new visual scripting tool is introduced in Webex Contact Center, which allows partners and customers to create customized flows that automate contact center processes. The first release supports flows that handle voice contacts. These flows control how calls flow through the business. This powerful new application has all the functionality of Control Scripts and more, including an updated user interface and Activity nodes with new functionality.

Conversational IVR - Self-service

Self-service is enhanced with new features. The following IVR (Interactive Voice Response) functionalities and activities are available in Flow Designer:

Text-to-Speech: This functionality converts arbitrary strings, words, sentences, and variables into natural-sounding, synthetic human speech that can be played dynamically to a caller.

Virtual Agent: This activity provides the capability to handle conversations with end users. The virtual agent, powered by Google’s Dialogflow capabilities, provides the speech based Self-service functionality to understand the intent of a conversation and assists the customer as part of the IVR experience.

Blind Transfer: This activity provides the capability to transfer a voice contact to an external Dial Number through the IVR without agent intervention.

Disconnect Contact: This activity provides the capability to disconnect a contact in the IVR.

The following functionalities are available in the Agent Desktop:

IVR Transcript: An agent can view the conversational IVR transcript in the IVR transcript widget.

CAD (Call Associated Data) Variables: An agent can view or edit CAD variables based on the configurations that are set in the call flow by the administrator.

The following report is available in the Analyzer:

IVR and CVA Dialog Flow Report: This report provides the self-service operational metrics, which includes the number of abandoned calls in self-service and the number of abandoned calls in a queue. Multi-level drill-down on the row segments in the report provides detailed information related to the corresponding entity.

Virtual Agent - Voice

Customers can now offer a Conversational IVR experience to callers by using the virtual agent created in Google Dialogflow. The customers no longer need to navigate through the unwieldy DTMF-based IVR menus; instead, they can speak for self-service.

Customers can configure the Dialogflow service account details in the Control Hub. After the account details are configured, the routing strategy provides an option to connect a Dialogflow virtual agent to drive the IVR. Customers can also configure how the escalated calls need to be handled by creating a mapping between escalation intents and agent queues.

Opt Out of Queue and Estimated Wait Time
This feature enables options to be presented to the customer using the IVR, while the customer waits in queue to be connected to an agent in the contact center. The customer can be informed of the estimated wait time (EWT) and Position in Queue (PiQ) using the Text-to-Speech functionality. Options can be provided to the customer such as to opt out of the queue and receive a callback, leave a voice message, or continue to wait in the queue.

Courtesy Callback

A customer, when waiting in queue for an agent to become available, can be offered the option to receive a callback rather than having to wait in queue to connect to the agent. The customer can retain the position in queue and receive a callback to the customer’s dialed number, or a number of the customer’s choice. This feature enables the contact center to enhance the customer experience, especially during peak hours when the wait time is more.

Outdial Transfer to Queue

An agent can make an outdial call from the Agent Desktop and can then transfer the call to another queue in the contact center if required, based on the conversation with the customer.

Outdial ANI

An agent can select a phone number from the outdial ANI list while making an outdial call. Outdial ANI enables an agent to select a phone number that is displayed as the caller ID to the recipient of the outdial call. The outdial ANI list must be added to an agent profile by the administrator.

Pause and Resume

An agent can invoke the Pause and Resume recording events from the Agent Desktop during a call. The events are stored in the customer activity record (CAR). The CAR is made available to WFO/WFM providers through an API. If there is a delay in resuming the recording beyond the allowed time lapse, the Privacy Shield feature auto-resumes the recording.

Change Team without Signing Out of the Agent Desktop

An agent signed in to the Desktop can change to a different team without signing out of the Desktop. The agent can change team only when there are no active contact requests or conversations. When an agent changes team successfully, the desktop layout and the routing strategy (voice or digital channel) of the new team are applied.

Agent Desktop Features

A new extensible Agent Desktop is available in this release. The following new features are introduced:

User Experience Enhancements: The Agent Desktop has undergone a user experience refresh. The desktop has a comprehensive new look with the functionalities configured by the administrator in the Desktop Layout.

Agent State Timer and Connected Timer: The agent state timer displays the time that has elapsed since the agent was in the current state. If an agent is in an Idle state and switches between any other Idle states, the timer displays the time spent in the current state, and the total time spent in all the Idle states together. After the agent accepts a request, the connected timer displays the time that has elapsed since the request was accepted.

Pause and Resume Recording: Agents can pause and resume the recording of a call.

Channel Capacity: Agents can view the number of contacts that can be handled on each media channel at a given point in time.

Notification Settings: Agents can enable or disable desktop notifications, silent notifications, and sound notifications.

Toaster Notifications: The Agent Desktop supports browser toaster notifications.

Screen Pop: The browser pops up on the Agent Desktop when an agent accepts an incoming call. The agent can view screen pop details either in a new browser tab, existing browser tab, or the Screen Pop tab of the Auxiliary Information pane, based on the screen pop display and the desktop layout settings.

Reset the entire desktop layout: Agents can reset a customized layout to the default desktop layout.

Keyboard Shortcuts: Agents can use keyboard shortcuts for specific desktop functionalities.

Switch to Dark Mode: Agents can enable or disable the dark background theme of the Agent Desktop.

Download Error Report: If an agent experiences problems with the Agent Desktop, the agent can download error logs and send the error logs to the administrator to investigate the issue.

Campaign Call: Agents can preview the customer's contact information before making an outbound preview campaign call.

Agent Sign Out: Agents are notified when the supervisor signs out an agent from the Agent Desktop.

Install as an Application: Agents can install the Agent Desktop as a desktop application.

Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian Bokmål, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.

Accessibility: The Agent Desktop supports features that improve accessibility for low-vision and vision-impaired users.

More user experience enhancements which include the following:

Incoming requests that appear either in the Task List pane or in a popover flash for a few seconds, before the agent state is changed to RONA.

A badge in the Task List pane indicates the number of unread chat and social messages in a conversation.

Browser support includes Microsoft Edge Chromium (MS Edge V79 and later).

Multiple agents can edit and save CAD (Call-Associated Data) variables with real-time updates.

Agents can make outdial calls when they are in the Available state.

Agents can enable sound notifications to play sound and use the slider to adjust the volume.

The Agent Interaction History pane displays details of the previous communications that the agent had in the last 24 hours, across customers.

The Contact History tab in the Auxiliary Information pane displays the previous communications with the customer for the last 90 days. The Contact History is consolidated for all digital channels, whereas for Voice, the history is restricted to the Voice Channel.

The Agent Desktop supports a responsive view that enables easy reading and navigation across small (< 640 pixels), medium (641 to 1007 pixels), and large (> 1008 pixels) screen resolutions. The recommended display size for the Agent Desktop is 500 x 400 pixels or higher. Non-responsive widgets cannot ensure the best user experience and are not displayed in the smaller view.

Desktop Layout

The Desktop Layout feature allows the administrator to customize the Agent Desktop layout and assign it to a team.

There are two types of desktop layouts:

Default Layout: A system-generated desktop layout that is available for all of the teams.

Custom Layout: The layout that the administrator creates based on the requirements of specific teams, and assigns to one or more teams.

The custom layout allows the administrator to customize the following:

Title and Logo

Drag-and-drop and resize widgets

Notification timer and maximum notification count

Custom icons, custom tabs, custom header, custom pages, and custom widgets

Persistent Widgets: Any custom widget can be defined as persistent. Persistent widgets are displayed on all pages of the Agent Desktop.

Screen Pop: The browser pops up on the Agent Desktop when an agent accepts an incoming call. The agent can view screen pop details either in a new browser tab, existing browser tab, or the Screen Pop tab of the Auxiliary Information pane based on the screen pop display and the desktop layout settings.

The administrator can add or remove the following widgets in the custom layout:

IVR Transcript

Campaign Contact and Call Guide

Cisco Webex Experience Management Widgets: Customer Experience Journey (CEJ) and Customer Experience Analytics (CEA)

The following Experience Management widgets are displayed on the Agent Desktop only if your administrator has configured the widgets:

Customer Experience Journey (CEJ): Displays all past survey responses from a customer in a chronological list. The widget helps agents to gain understanding about the customer’s past experiences with the business, and engage appropriately with the customer. This widget is automatically activated when an agent engages with a customer through a call, chat, or email. An agent can view ratings and scores such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and Customer Effort Score (CES) along with all other feedback collected from a customer.

Customer Experience Analytics (CEA): Displays the overall pulse of the customers or agents through industry-standard metrics such as NPS, CSAT, and CES, or other KPIs tracked within Experience Management.

When an agent signs in to the Agent Desktop, the desktop layout associated with the agent's team is available to the agent. The agent can customize the desktop layout by using the Drag-and-Drop and Resize features.

In addition to requesting data to be passed to the widgets through properties and attributes, the administrator can perform more complex operations by consuming and manipulating the system data within the widget by using the Agent Desktop JavaScript SDK (Software Development Kit) package.

RONA Popover

If an agent is unable to accept any contact request (voice or digital channel) within the time period configured by the administrator, the contact request is returned to the queue and the system changes the agent state to RONA. The system cannot deliver any new contact requests to an agent who is in the RONA state. When an agent is in the RONA state, a popover appears with the following options:

Go To Idle: Indicates that the agent can change the state from RONA to the default idle reason configured by the administrator.

Go To Available: Indicates that the agent can change the state from RONA to Available, to accept and respond to contact requests.

New URL for Analyzer

Users can now access Analyzer using the new URL https://analyzer.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/analyzer/home.

Using Webex Contact Center with Webex Calling

Customers who are subscribed to both Webex Contact Center and Webex Calling can use their Webex Calling Dial Number (endpoints) as their preferred agent endpoint devices when used in conjunction with the Webex Contact Center Agent Desktop. This enables agents to log in using their Webex Calling extension number and be remote on supported Webex Calling devices and clients, and enable on-net call transfers to internal users on both the solutions bypassing the PSTN and saving on toll charges.

Webex Contact Center supports the following agent devices for Webex Calling endpoint devices (clients):

Webex Calling Desk Phone

Webex Calling Desktop App (PC Audio)

Webex Mobile App on the cell phone

Webex Client that is integrated with Webex Calling (PC Audio)

Call Manager Integration with Webex Contact Center

This feature enables integrating Webex Contact Center with On-premises Call Manager via the Webex Calling Local Gateways (LGW) connectivity option. With this capability, Webex Contact Center agents can use the connected Private Branch Exchange (PBX) extensions as the agent device.

This feature enables enterprises that use LGWs, such as the Cisco Unified Border Element (CUBE) or the Session Border Controller (SBC) along with Webex Calling, to integrate with Webex Contact Center.

OEM Integration with Acqueon - Preview Campaigns

Webex Contact Center is integrated with the Acqueon LCM (Link and Campaign Manager) application to enable outbound preview campaign management for the voice channel. Administrators can configure outbound preview campaigns using the Acqueon LCM interface. Agents can then initiate campaign calls from the Agent Desktop. When an agent initiates a campaign call, a new contact is dynamically retrieved from the ongoing active preview campaigns and assigned to the agent.

Various campaign reports are available in the Campaign Manager modules. Administrators can measure the effectiveness of campaigns via the OEM Integration with Acqueon report in the Analyzer.

Cisco Webex Experience Management Post-Call Survey

Webex Contact Center is integrated with Webex Experience Management, the platform for Customer Experience Management (CEM). This enables administrators to configure SMS and email post‐call surveys to collect feedback from customers.

Social Messaging Channels

Social Messaging is trending as a major way to connect with businesses, to perform all types of one-on-one customer service and query processing tasks. It is asynchronous and personal; Social Messaging apps are already familiar to customers as a means to communicate with friends and family.

Webex Contact Center now supports Social Messaging channels. Customers can interact with agents in the contact center via Facebook Messenger and SMS (Short Message Service). While customers use their Social Messaging app to interact with agents, agents handle the contacts similar to web chat, which does not require any additional training. Additionally, Social Messaging conversations can be integrated with a Virtual Agent (bot) for Chat to enable customers to get self-help before being routed to a live agent, just as in web chat. Intents detected by the Virtual Agent can be used either to service the request directly, or to route the contact appropriately.

The integration supports Google Dialogflow. For SMS, customers need to procure one or more SMS numbers from the supported vendor MessageBird (www.messagebird.com). For Facebook Messenger integration, customers must have a Facebook page.

Business Rules Engine Support through Flow Control

The Business Rules Engine (BRE) provides a means for tenants to incorporate their data into the Webex Contact Center environment for custom routing as well as for general implementation. With this feature, new and existing customers who are already using the Business Rules Engine (BRE) solution with Webex Contact Center can leverage BRE data through Flow Control for their organization.

Service Specific Administrator Role for Webex Contact Center

A new service specific administrator role is introduced for Webex Contact Center. This role can be assigned to external administrators and administrators in the customer organization. The service specific administrator role enables restricted administrative access on Control Hub. An administrator with this role can manage contact center licenses and administer the contact center service.

Support for provisioning administrators is also enabled in this release. Partner administrators who have provisioning administrator privileges for the contact center service can perform all activities that a partner full administrator can perform.

Support for external read-only administrators is available with this release. External administrators with the read-only role can access all Webex Contact Center administrative interfaces in the read-only mode.

External Administrator Support in Flow Designer

Flow Designer is enhanced to support external administrators. External administrators can view, create, modify, and delete flows using Flow Designer. External administrators with read-only privileges can only view the flows in Flow Designer.

Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy defines an approved list of trusted domains that can be accessed from Webex Contact Center applications. This feature helps comply with the content security policy framework that browsers enforce.
