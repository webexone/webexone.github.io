# Agent Desktop Overview

## Login Process

- To Login to the Agent Desktop, launch Google Chrome and to the URL: [https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com](https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com)

> **Note: Please Google Chrome as the browser to use the all new WebRTC Voice Option**

> Tip: You can also find this link under Control Hub: [admin.webex.com](https://admin.webex.com) > Contact Center > Settings

- Once you're in the login page, enter the agent credentials (username and password)

> In this example, please use the specific login for your attendee ID

![agent-desktop](/assets/images/agent/01-image.png)

![agent-desktop](/assets/images/agent/02-image.png)

- This is the station Login Screen. Agents may input the number where they need to receive incoming and outdial calls.

> We will use the new feature of Desktop telephony that uses the browser as a device to directly receive calls.

- Notice that the voice option defaults to "Desktop".

- Select Team1 from the list. Agents can belong to multiple teams, but they can only receive calls of 1 specific teams. Your agent is configured for 2 teams.

- Check the **Remember My Credentials** box to save your credentials for future sign-ins.

- Click Sign in to be connected to telephony and complete the login process.

![agent-desktop](/assets/images/agent/03-image.png)

> NOTE: Agents cannot access the Agent Desktop from multiple browsers or multiple tabs of the same browser window. In that case, a warning message will be displayed

![agent-desktop](/assets/images/agent/04-image.png)

> The video below shows a demo about the agent login process and the available options:

![agent-desktop](/assets/images/agent/AgentLogin.gif)

**NOTE:**

> The login device and DN can be enforced on the Desktop Profile as follows

- If your administrator configures the default Dial Number (DN), the default DN is prepopulated in the Dial Number and Extension fields.
- If your administrator restricts the DN to the default DN, you cannot edit the prepopulated DN when signing in to the Agent Desktop.

- They can choose between Dial Number or Extension or Desktop

  - Extension: Just in case the agent is using Webex Calling or some other softphone as calling endpoint

    - Dial Number: E.164 format phone number
      - If you check the **International Dialing Format** box, you can choose the country code based on your geographical location from the drop-down list. You can also enter a country code or country name to filter the list. Dial numbers are validated based on the country code

## Make an Incoming Call

> In this section, you will will interact as an agent and test an Incoming call. Review the video of the lab section above to understand the different call handling options.
> {: .block-tip }

- In order to test properly an incoming call, first we need to make sure that we have all the call handling options enabled

- Login with your administrator user in the **Control Hub** and navigate to _Services > Contact Center > Settings > Desktop_
  - Make sure that **`End Call`** and **`End Consult`** are enabled
  - You can also configure _Auto Wrapup and RONA timeouts_

<br/>
(screenshot)
- Now open the **Management Portal** and navigate to _Provisioning > Desktop Profiles_ and edit _your Desktop Profile_:
  - In the **Collaboration** tab:
    - Set the **Buddy Teams** to **`All`**
    - Enable **`Consult to Queue`**

<br/>

(screenshot)

- Navigate to _Provisioning > Queue_ and edit your Queue
  - Enable **`Permit Recording, Record All Calls and Pause/Resume`**
    - Make sure that these settings are also enabled at tenant level
  - You can also set the _Recording Pause Duration_. This is the maxiumum duration that an agent can pause the recording

<br/>

(screenshot)

- Now place it's time to test the incoming call
  - Login in both in the **Agent Desktop** and **Webex App** with _your Agent 1_ user
  - Input the corresponding Webex App Extension in the Agent Desktop Station Login (you can check this info in the Users module of Control Hub)
  - Move to **`Available`** state
  - Place an incoming call to the DN mapped to your EP (You should have mapped your EP in Lab 2)

<br/>

(screenshot)

- Accept the call in the Webex App of _your Agent 1_
  - Check the **CAD variables** and try to edit any Global Variable
  - Change to **`Engage - Idle`**. This way you will not receive any other digital channel requests

<br/>

(screenshot)

- Let's play with the call interaction buttons
  - Click on **`Hold`** to pause the conversation with the end-customer and click on **`Resume`** to talk with him again
  - Click on **`Pause Recording`**, say some personal infor and click again on **`Resume`** to continue the recording
  - Click on **`Transfer`** and select the **`Welcome_EP`**
    - End-customer be redirected to a common EP already created
  - **End** the call (this can be done from customer or agent perspective) and select any **Wrap-up code**

> For this part, you will need a third calling device for interacting as aSupervisor
> {: .block-warning }
> <br/>

- Now, using a different browser, login in the **Agent Desktop** with _your Supervisor_ user and move to **`Available`** status
  - In a separate device (you mobile phone for example), login in Webex App with your _Supervisor_ user
  - Place the call from the third calling endpoint (your personal phone for example)
  - Try **`Consult, Conference and Transfer`** functions between End Customer, Agent and Supervisor.

## Handling Calls

> In the following video you will see how to handle incoming calls and what are the different agent states:
> {: .block-tip }

<div style="padding-bottom:60.25%; position:relative; display:block; width: 100%">
	<iframe src="https://app.vidcast.io/share/embed/f5a79811-eb60-4925-b11a-a8586760a3d3" width="100%" height="100%" title="Calls Handling" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute; top:0; left: 0"></iframe>
</div>
<br/>

#### Agent States:

- **Available**: Indicates that you are ready to accept and respond to contact requests that are routed to you. After you sign in, you must select Available from the drop-down list to accept voice call, chat, email, and social messaging conversation requests.

- **Idle**: Indicates that you are signed in but not ready to accept any routed requests. When you sign in to the desktop, your state is set to the default idle reason configured by your administrator.

- **RONA (Redirection on No Answer)**: Indicates that you have not accepted a voice call, chat, email, or social messaging conversation request within the specified time. Your administrator configures the time available to accept an incoming request from any channel. If you cannot accept the request within the specified time displayed in the timer, the action button on the popover flashes for a few seconds and your state automatically changes to RONA. The request is returned to the queue. When your state changes to RONA, a popover appears and you can select the state that you want to be moved: to Idle or to Available

- **Engaged**: indicates that you are busy and connected with a customer. When you have accepted the contact request, the Available state changes to the Engaged - Available label. When you're in this state, you can continue to receive active requests on other channels, depending on the channel capacity. If you don't want to receive more requests, you can select any Idle state, so you will be moved to Engaged - Idle label.

#### Manage Voice Calls

- **Call Associated Data (CAD) variables**: These variables allow the administrator to collect call data such as a case number or any action code of the customer. In Flow Designer, your administrator configures the variables, labels of the variables, and the order in which they must appear on the Interaction Control panel. While you are on a call, you can edit the CAD variables if your administrator configures the CAD variables as editable.

- **Hold/Resume**: You can put the customer on hold so that you can consult with another agent or lookup additional information without having the customer listening to you. Click on Resume to take a call off hold.

- **Pause/Resume Recording**: Your administrator can choose for each Queue either to record all the calls or not. In case the recording is enabled, the agent can Pause and Resume the recording.

- **End**: After you have helped your customer with queries, it is a good practice to ask the customer to end the voice call. If necessary, you can also end the call. When the customer ends the call, agent will need to select some Wrap Up Reasons from the dialog box appears.

- **Consult**: You can initiate a consult call with another agent while you are on an active call with a customer.

- **Transfer**: If you cannot resolve a customer query and want to escalate the active voice call (inbound or outbound), you can transfer the call to another agent or supervisor.

- Either for **Consult and Transfer** you have the following options:

  - _Agent_: You can either select an agent from the drop-down list, or use the search field to filter the list. The drop-down list displays the names of available agents.

  - _Queue_: You can select a Queue or Entry Point from the drop-down list, or use the search field to filter the list. The drop-down list displays the queues that are available to transfer the call.

  - _DN_: You can enter a name or number; select a name or number from the drop-down list; or use the search field to filter the list. The drop-down list shows the grouped list of contacts in your address book. Names are listed along with the numbers for the contacts in the address book.

- **Conference**: To start a three-way conference call between you, the customer and another agent. For this option, you (primary agent) must have initiated a consult call. Click Transfer to transfer the call to the consulting agent. The consulted agent can exit the call by clicking Exit Conference, and the call continues between the primary agent and the customer. Only the primary agent can end the Conference.

## Active Interaction Interface

> Desktop multi-language support is based on the language preference settings on the browser. Currently, we support 29 languages:
> Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (UK), English (US), Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.

![Image1](/assets/images/agentDesktopOverview.png)

When you receive an active interaction, you will notice that the
Agent Desktop is divided into **6 sections**. In the image above you can see a general view of the Agent Desktop and where each section is located.

Here is an overview of the sections:

1. **Task List**: When a request is routed to your queue and you are _Available_, a new request appears in your Task List pane. You must accept the requests to start communication with the customer.

2. **Horizontal Header**: Basic functionalities such as: Title and logo, Agent availability state, Notification Center, Outdial and User Profile. We will explain more in detail some User Profile options in the next section of the lab.

3. **Interaction Control**: When you accept a voice call (inbound or outbound), by default, the Interaction Control pane is expanded. This pane includes: customer information (CAD variables), timers (for example: connected and call on hold time) and call control buttons (Record, Hold, Transfer...).

4. **Auxiliary Information**: The center pane displays details based on your selection of the contact card in the Task List panel. For Voice requests, it will display the customer contacts history. Whereas for any digital channels (email, chat or social messaging), you will see the whole conversation with the customer and you will be able to send new messages.

5. **Agent Interaction History**: You can view your previous contacts of the agent across all the channels (voice, email, chat, and social) in this pane. The pane displays details for the last 24 hours. Moreover, for Voice channel you can callback to the contact phone number.

6. **Navigation pane**: By default you can find the following icons here: Home, Agent Performance Statistics and Help. However, you can customize it and add some additional icons and widgets.

# BONUS: Desktop Customizations

The next section covers advanced customizations elements on the Agent Desktop and showcases the HOW in terms of customizing the desktop.
Refer to the sections to understand how the desktop layout was configured.

To get a copy of the Desktop Layout used in Webex One, go to:

You can open this file in any file editor.

## Basic JSON elements

The following are the top-level and most important properties to know for JSON layout:

- **`appTitle`**: To specify a title on the horizontal header of the Desktop. The default title is `Webex Contact Center`.
