# Introduction

Digital channels are now more impactful than ever. 
These labs are specially designed for this Webex ONE session. The main purpose of the labs is to give a clear understanding of New Digital Channels functionality. You will learn how to create and configure all digital channels including Chat, Email, Whatsapp and SMS. You will get a clear understanding of how to use scripts and troubleshoot issues by using the debug console.
