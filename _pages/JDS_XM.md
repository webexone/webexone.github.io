# XM v2
- We announced on October 14th, 2022, the End of Sale of WxM V1 Standalone and End of Life WxM V1 Standalone will be on November 14th, 2024.
- We are currently working on the next version, Webex Experience Management v2 (XM v2), which will be directly integrated into Webex CC and Webex CCE to provide improved abilities to collect explicit/implicit feedback and data, store and visualize customer feedback data through surveys over various channels and displays information in user friendly dashboards.
- XM v2 will be available in the next 3-5 months tentatively.
- Here is a preview of how XM v2 could look and function, this is an example of Post Interaction Surveys using Digital channels of Webex Connect.
