## **Introduction**

#### **Lab Objective**

This lab is designed to introduce the audience to the digital channels (Webex Connect) platform, its architecture and its provisioning. In addition this lab will provide the instructions to verify if Webex Connect has been provisioned successfully.

#### **Pre-requisite**

1.  Admin credentials to login to Control Hub and Webex Contact Center administration portal.

## **1. Webex Connect architecture**

Webex Connect consists of 2 main components, Connect and Engage, which are directly integrated with the Webex Contact Center platform (as per the drawing).  
The access to Webex Connect is restricted to Administrators only.

![Architecture](/assets/images/DC_Architecture.png)

**Connect** serves as the entry point for all the messages received through any digital channel (email, chat, SMS, Messenger Facebook, WhatsApp) and as the intelligence for routing them. It hosts most of the configuration the Admin will create: flows, assets, bots, scheduled events and webhooks.  
The access to Connect happens via a dedicated URL which is generated and provided to the administrator at the time of the initial provisioning.  
Users in Connect are added and managed locally.

**Engage** serves as the host for media and agents. Agents which are configured in Webex Contact Center gets automatically synchronized with Engage. In CPaaS (the standalone version of Webex Connect) Engage provides a dedicated agent console solution, while with Webex Contact Center it leaves that control to the native Webex Agent Desktop. Within Engage the Admin can customize some cosmetics of each channel and create templated responses agents can select and use inside their Agent Desktop.  
The access to Engage happens via a dedicated icon inside the Webex Contact Center Management Portal.  
Users in Engage are automatically synchronized with Webex Control Hub.

## **2. Webex Connect provisioning**

-   Go to https://admin.webex.com
-   Login with tenant administrator credentials
-   Under ‘Services’ select ‘Contact Center’ > ‘Settings’ > ‘General’
-   Verify under ‘Service Details’ > ‘Digital Channel’ is set to ‘IMI Digital’

![Provisioning1](/assets/images/DC_Provisioning1.png)

> In case the ‘Digital Channel’ section prompts a different value you will need to reach out Cisco for support to get this setting corrected before proceeding further.

-   Under ‘Services’ select ‘Contact Center’ > ‘Settings’ > ‘Digital’
-   Select the button ‘Provision Digital Channels’

![Provisioning1](/assets/images/DC_Provisioning2.png)

-   Then select from the list of administrators the account who will become the Owner of the new Webex Connect Tenant > Click on ‘Select

![Provisioning1](/assets/images/DC_Provisioning3.png)

-   Wait approximately 5 minute for the automated provisioning process to complete. After this time, the selected administrator will receive an activation email.
-   Open the email and click on ‘JOIN THE TEAM’

![Provisioning1](/assets/images/DC_Invite.png)

-   Follow the instructions to activate your account and set a local password.
-   Once the activation is completed you will access the Connect portal > bookmark the website URL

> For security reason, the activation is only valid for 24 hours since its delivery. Please activate your account immediately. In case you don’t receive the activation email, or not use it within 24 hours, will need to reach out Cisco for support.

## **3. Webex Connect provisioning verification**

-   Go to https://admin.webex.com
-   Login with tenant administrator credentials
-   Under ‘Services’ select ‘Contact Center’ > ‘Settings’ > ‘Digital’
-   Verify Digital channels setup for Webex Contact Center is completed.

![Provisioning1](/assets/images/DC_Provisioned1.png)

-   Return to ‘Services’ select ‘Contact Center’ > ‘Settings’ > ‘General’ > ‘Advanced Configuration’ > Select ‘Go to Webex Contact Center Management Portal’ to cross launch to administration portal
-   In Administration portal, select ‘New Digital Channels’ to cross launch into the new component ‘Engage’
-   No additional login(or credentials) are required. The login to Engage portal should be seamless

![Provisioning1](/assets/images/DC_Provisioned2.png)

-   In Engage portal, select Users > Search
-   Verify that users with Administrator and Premium Agent previleges are replicated with role type ‘Administrative’ and ‘Customer Care’ roles
-   Please note that the user account with which you have logged in will not show up in the engage user list. This is expected behaviour.

| [Overview of Connect menu items](#overview-of-connect-menu-items) | Read & Understand         | EASY                | 15 min                 |


## **Introduction**

#### **Lab Objective**

This lab is designed to introduce the Connect interface, which is used for the configuration and orchestration of all digital channels. In this lab you will not find configuration steps, the goal is to understand the purpose and use of each menu item.

#### **Pre-requisite**

1.  Connect URL for browser access.
2.  Admin credentials to login to Connect administration portal.


## **Overview of Connect menu items**

Connect interface is divided in two main parts: the main menu on the left side and the configuration of the selected object in the center-right side.  
Move your mouse pointer on each icon of the menu to see its name and the available options. Click on the ‘>>’ icon in the left bottom of the menu to expand the menu and see the description of each item in addition to the shortcut icons.

This is the introduction video. It walks through the menu items and explains the purposes of each tab.

<div style="padding-bottom:60.25%; position:relative; display:block; width: 100%">
	<iframe src="https://app.vidcast.io/share/embed/4065cc46-1389-4ada-ae04-2e0954288a23" width="100%" height="100%" title="WxConnect.mp4" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute; top:0; left: 0"></iframe>
</div>

#### **1. Services**

Services are containers for all the flows the administrator will typically configure to orchestrate and route incoming messages from customers to agents. The administrators can create, name and arrange Services following their preferences.

-   After login into Connect, Services will be automatically selected. You can click on any of the existing services to explore their content. Use the search toolbar on the top to navigate and filter the available services when there are many.
-   To create your own service click on **SERVICES** > **CREATE NEW SERVICE** button. Please set the **SERVICE NAME** with a name of your choice.
-   You will be redirected to your service configuration. In the **DASHBOARD** tab, at the right bottom, you can see the traffic statistic per each channel, flow execution, and Messaging API statistic.
-   Click on a second tab **FLOWS** to see the list of all flows created for that service. You should not have any pre-built services right now.
-   Click on the **RULES** tab to see which triggers are configured for which flows. Again, there are no triggers right now.
-   Click on **API** tab. Here you can get the **SERVICE ID** and **SERVICE SECRET** which are needed for external applications which are using API that are meant to trigger flows within this service.
-   Click on the **SETTINGS** tab. Here you can rename or delete the service. You can add a description for better organization and even select the checkbox under ‘Service Locking’ so to prevent other users to apply any uncontrolled changes to it.

#### **2. Reports**

While the official platform for the Contact Center solution remains Analyzer, Connect offers the possibility to generate historical utilization reports for the existing flows.

-   Click on the next item in menu **REPORTS** > select the desired service in **ENTITY** (use the search bar on the top to navigate and filter the available services when there are many) > select one Channel (will collect data from all flows of the same kind) or one specific Flow > Select the desired Time Period > click on the “**GET REPORTS**” button. If there is no data, you will get a “No records found.” message. Later you can find here such data as numbers of Submitted, Rejected, Delivered, Read, and Failed messages.

#### **3. Assets**

Assets function as triggers and they are very similar to Entry Points in the Webex Contact Center Management Portal.

-   Go to the next item in menu **ASSETS** > **Numbers**. This will show you the list of SMS numbers added to the platform. SMS numbers are provided upon request by Cisco. Admin is not required to apply any configuration here.
-   Now click on **ASSETS** > **Apps**. This section allows the administrator to add and manage the ‘trigger’ for each channel (except SMS). Apps require dedicated configuration to function properly.
-   Click on next item **ASSETS** > **Integrations**. This section contains the list of all integrations configured for different events, which allow Connect to communicate with other components. By default, you will find two integrations: Webex CC Task (which allows Connect to communicate with the Webex Contact Center backend) and Webex CC Engage (which allows Connect to communicate with the Engage backend)

#### **4. Tools**

The Tools section contains several additional capabilities, but just few of them are commonly used.

-   Click on **TOOLS** > **Download SDKs**. Here you can download SDK if you want to build your own application.
-   Go to **TOOLS** > **Templates**. Here you can create new templated messages that will be triggered inside the desired flows so to programmatically respond to customers and collect the desired information.
-   Now go to **TOOLS >** **Export Logs**. This section allow the administrator to collect detailed logs for either Inbound or Outbound messages received/sent in a desired time frame. This option becomes very useful during troubleshooting. To consult the logs, select your Service name, select your Channel, time period, and click **DOWNLOAD** button. Wait few seconds for the report to be generated (the Status will change to ‘Ready for download’)

#### **5. Debug**

The Debug section is extremely useful when troubleshooting any ongoing issues. It offers the possibility to check some detailed information about incoming and outgoing messages, which can help the administrators to better understand what could be the root cause of occurring problems.

-   Click on **DEBUG**.
-   Use **Query by Transaction ID** when looking for a specific conversation (this ID is retrievable inside the flow designer, this will be covered in another lab).
-   Use **Query by Destination ID** when looking for outbound messages (typically from agent to customer) toward a specific destination (i.e. number, email, etc).
-   Use **Historical Log** for a more generic search, select the query Channel type and date range. Click on the **SEARCH** button and check if you have any data.

#### **6. Help**

The Help section provides access to the available documentation.

-   Go to the next menu item by clicking on **HELP** > **Documentation** which redirects to the Webex Connect documentation portal. All menu items are documented in that documentation.
-   Go to the second item in the **HELP** menu by clicking on **API Reference**. This will forward you to the API documentation portal.
-   Now switch to the **Change Log** item in the same menu. Here you can find the updates of the product.

#### **7. App Tray**

Use the App Tray to access advanced platform capabilities.

-   Click on the **APP TRAY** > **Bot Builder**. This will redirect you to the Bot Builder tool where you will create the bots to automate the customers interactions. This section is covered in detail in a dedicated lab.
-   Click on the **APP TRAY** > Event Scheduler. This will redirect you to the Scheduler tool where you will create the events and related schedule to programmatically trigger flows. This section is commonly used for outbound campaign on digital channels, and it’s covered in detail in a separated lab.

#### **8. Settings**

The Settings session allows the administrator to review and manage users and team settings. More details on user management will be provided in a dedicated lab.

-   Click on the next item **Settings** > **Profile Settings** and check the Profile settings.
-   Go to **SETTINGS** > **Tenant Settings** and verify the configured Time Zone and Date Format.
-   Open **SETTINGS** > **Usage** to see the general statistic of the entire tenant.
-   Click on the next item **SETTINGS** > **Contact Support**. Here you can check the support contact details in case you need to escalate any query.
-   Click on the next item **SETTINGS** > **Teammates**. From here you can add more users to Connect or change the permissions for existing users.
-   Go to **SETTINGS** > **Groups/Teams** where you can create a new group or team. Please refer to _“here”_ link to see the explanation of Groups and Teams.
-   As the final step click on the **Logout** in the **SETTINGS** menu and make sure that you are signed out from the Connect.

## **1. User Roles and Permissions**

Connect allows its administrators to add local users and set the with different level of permissions. Here below the list of available roles:

-   Owner - first configured users (is the account that has been indicated at the time of the provisioning of Webex Connect tenant). The Owner has full permissions in the tenant. Only 1 Owner can exist in a tenant.
-   Full Access – this is the most commonly used role for all other administrators that need access to Connect.
-   Limited Access
-   Read Only
-   Restricted

To review in details the permission assigned to each role please refer to the official documentation [https://help.imiconnect.io/docs/user-roles-and-hierarchy](https://help.imiconnect.io/docs/user-roles-and-hierarchy)

The Owner is the only role who can provide the permission to other users to Decrypt Log (which is an essential permission to view logs when troubleshooting).  
If an Owner leaves your organization, please reach out to your support contact the Partner Success team (PSM) to request the Owner change.  
Connect shall be accessed only by system administrators and not by agents or supervisors.

## **2. Users organization**

Connect allows the Owner to create local users in containers called **Groups** and **Teams**. Users created within a Group or a Team will be able to access the configuration created within such container and below, but not to the configuration created at levels above. Users can be create in one of the following containers:

-   Tenant level – can contain users and Groups
-   Group – can contain users and Teams
-   Team – can contain users only

> To create new groups or teams go to ‘Settings’ > 'Groups/Teams'

## **3. Login to Connect portal**

-   Access Connect URL (this is specific to the tenant you are using)
-   Login the provided credentials

> Please contact the Partner Success team (PSM) if there are any challenges identifying the Connect Owner details

![UserLogin](assets/images/DC_Login.png)

## **4. Add new users with administrator role**

-   Once logged in to Connect, go to ‘Settings’ > ‘Teammates’
-   Add a new user (must be a working emailID) and select ‘Full access’ role and click ‘Invite user’

![AddUser](assets/images/DC_AddUser.png)

## **5. New user activation**

-   Click ‘Join the team’ link in the welcome email to complete user registration.
-   Provide your name and setup the passwords, click ‘Next’.
-   Fill out additional details about yourself and click ‘Next’.
-   The user will automatically login into the Connect portal.
-   The user will have to inform the tenant Owner about the successful creation of the account > the Owner will go to ‘Settings’ > ‘Teammates’ > click ‘Edit’ for the specified user > mark the checkbox for Decrypt Logs > click ‘Save’

## Configuration Order

![ConfigOrder](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.5_1.png)
 
## 1. Node Authorization for Webex CC Task and Engage nodes

Webex Connect is required to provide a valid access token for using various Webex Contact Center and Webex Engage APIs. The access token is generated using the authorization details configured within the ‘Node Runtime Authorization’ field that Webex Contact Center users are required to provide during flow configuration.
- To authorize a pre-built integration go to Assets -> Integrations. The integrations which are not yet authorized show the status as Authorization Pending.
- In front of Webex CC Engage Click Actions -> Manage.
 ![Access](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.5_2.gif)
- On the Manage Integrations page, scroll down to the Node Authorizations section. This section lists all the authorizations mapped to this integration.
- Click Action → Add Authorization associated with the WxCC Engage Authorisation, where Auth Type is oauth2 and Status is Authorization Pending.
 ![Authorization](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.5_3.png)
- Enter the Authorization Name and click Authorize. In that example we use WxCC Engage Authorisation.
 ![Authorize](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.5_4.png)
- Click on the back button for being redirected back to Integrations page and in front of Webex CC Task Click Actions → Manage.
 ![Manage](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.5_5.gif)
- On the Manage Integrations page, scroll down to the Node Authorizations section. This section lists all the authorizations mapped to this integration. Click Action → Add Authorization associated with the WxCC Authorisation, where Auth Type is oauth2 and Status is Authorization Pending.
 ![Authorization](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.5_6.png)
- Enter the Authorization Name (for example: WxCC Authorisation) and click Authorize. As the result the pop-up appears where you need to enter your Cisco admin email address and click Sign In.
 ![Authenticate](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.5_7.png)
- Click back button for being redirected back to Integrations page. Verify that the status of the authorizations is changed to Authorized.

## 3. Setup RONA timers
If an agent doesn’t answer a contact request, the contact request will return to the queue and the agent state will change to Redirection on No Answer (RONA). In this task, you will play with the feature that allows administrators to override the default RONA timeout values at the tenant level for every channel type to suit the business needs of the organization. The available channels are:
- Telephony
- Chat
- Email
- Social (Facebook and WhatsApp)

- Log in to the Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com
- Navigate to Services -> Contact Center -> Settings -> Desktop -> RONA Timeouts.

## Introduction

#### Lab Objective

This lab is designed to introduce the logic and methodology behind building flows that will handle incoming conversation via digital channels. Throughout this lab you will learn how to navigate the flow designer, understand how to read and configure nodes and how flows are being executed. In this lab you will not find configuration steps, the goal is to understand how to approach the build of a new flow.

#### Pre-requisites

1.  Connect URL for browser access.
2.  Admin credentials to login to Connect administration portal.


## 1. Understanding Connect Flows

#### 1. Flows summary

Here below a brief list of key aspects of any flow in Webex Connect:
	- Flows can be freely build by the admin following customers’ requirement
	- Flows can be located in any Service, the Admin is free to organize Flows and Services following the desired order and naming convention.
	- Flows can be triggered by Assets, Events or Webhooks.
	- Flows are built using and connecting functional nodes to execute the desired behaviour
	- Every time a customer sends a new message, the associated Asset and then Flow are triggered from their starting node.
	- Connect flows introduce the concept of Conversation: whenever a user has to send multiple messages via a single channel, which have to be considered as part of the same thread, the system shall create a Conversation ID, so to map and present all the messages together (from the user and from the agent).
	- Flows do not automatically associate incoming messages from the same users/customers as part of the same thread, a dedicate node is required to check 
	- As reference, sample flows for each digital channel can be imported from the GitHub page (links in channels specific labs).

#### 2. Create new flows

You can create a new flow from scratch to explore the flow designer interface and its nodes. To create a new flow:

- Access your Connect tenant
- Navigate to Service > select or create your service >  select the Flows tab > click on any of the two ‘Create Flow’ buttons
- Enter the a name inside the ‘Flow Name’ > under Type select ‘Work Flow’ > under Method select ‘New Flow’ > Select the ‘Start From Scratch’ icon > click on Create
- From the ‘Select Trigger Category’ select any of the channels (i.e. Email)
- You will be redirected to the flow canvas, already inside the first node in the flow > click on Cancel

#### 3. Flow designer and node navigation

The flow designer is divided in three main section:

- Toolbar on top – containing the flow name and status, the settings, save and ‘make live’ buttons.
- Canvas in the middle – where the administrator can arrange the node to execute the desired workflow.
- Node menu on the left – containing all the nodes the admin can use (by dragging them inside the Canvas

<div style="padding-bottom:60.25%; position:relative; display:block; width: 100%">
	<iframe src="https://app.vidcast.io/share/embed/20277a81-1d69-470b-bb69-69c9f2a7b5a3" width="100%" height="100%" title="Canvas.mp4" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute; top:0; left: 0"></iframe>
</div>

Nodes are categorized between Utilities, Channels and Integrations depending on their use but they all follow the same structure. To check a node simply drag and drop it into the canvas and double click on it. Inside each node you will find the:

- Node Name – Can be edited by clicking on the pencil icon.
- Configuration tab – Every node needs to be properly configured to be executed. Each node has its own set of required Variables to be set. The details about how to configure each parameter can be found in the nodes’ specific documentation inside the Connect Help page.
- Transition Actions tab – use to configure additional activities before or after the node is executed (i.e. set desired values to additional variables).
- Node ID – Indicates the unique number identifier for this node.
- Input Variables section – Click on it to expand the section. You will see a list of all the Output and Custom Variables (grouped by node of origin) from the previously connected nodes.
- Output Variables section – Click on it to expand the section. You will see a list of variables (and their names) the node generates when successfully executed.
- Node Outcomes section – Click on it to expand the section. You will see a list of which and how many outcomes (exit connections) the node has. When closing the node configuration you will notice coloured dots on the right side of the node indicating the Outcomes. Drag those dots onto other nodes to connect them together, or into an empty point of the canvas if no further actions are needed.

When using nodes’ Output Variables inside the configuration of other nodes, administrator will have to use the following syntax: $(nX.outputvariablename), where X is the node ID that has generated that variable.

<div style="padding-bottom:60.25%; position:relative; display:block; width: 100%">
	<iframe src="https://app.vidcast.io/share/embed/de1a70ff-5016-4bf0-8915-ec8b11374ce3" width="100%" height="100%" title="node.mp4" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute; top:0; left: 0"></iframe>
</div>

#### 4. Building a new flow

As for any contact center flow, before proceeding building a new flow it’s always recommended to collect all the requirements as well as a draft of the intended workflow.  
In addition to this, for the digital channels it’s crucial to distinguish the type of use for the flow: as mentioned in the chapter 1, Connect flows are executed from their starting node any time they are triggered
> excepts when using a Receive Node inside the flow itself, beyond the scope of this lab.

For this reason the administrator should initially clarify if the flow shall be always triggered by distinct and unrelated sources or if multiple messages could come from the same source as part of a unique conversation. For most of the cases, when customers need to interact with your services, especially when expecting to connect with an agent, all their messages must be grouped into a uniquely identifiable thread. In Connect this is called **Conversation ID**.  
For all the flows where you expect to have an ongoing conversation, your flow shall be built with an initial check, ideally after the starting node, where you will need to check if the incoming message is part, or not of an existing conversation, so to appropriately manage and route it accordingly. Here below a recommended flow structure:

1. Accept incoming message via dedicated channel node.
2. Use the Resolve Conversation node to verify if the incoming message shall trigger the creation of a new Conversation ID ("created" outcome) or if such message shall be **appended** to an existing Conversation ID ("appended" outcome). The Resolve Conversation node also offer two additional outcomes, which allow the administrators to further customize their flows: "accepted" is triggered when the node receive the message (it might allow admins to add a confirmation response the system has successfully received the query), "reopened" is triggered when the same customer was already in a conversation with the system in the past, but that conversation was terminated by one of the 2 sides (or timed out).
3. Use the Queue Task node to queue the incoming message to the desired queue/team after the "created" and "reopened" outcomes only.
4. Connect the Close Task node for any failure outcomes for any nodes connected after the Append Conversation node. This will ensure the Conversation ID you created is properly terminated even if your flow experience some issues.

When building a flow it is also recommend to appropriately handle the potential failure of each node by including messages back to the customer informing them about an ongoing issue.


#### 5. Activating a flow

When a flow is being edited, its status appear as ‘Working Draft’ on the top-left of the browser window. Once the editing has been completed and you wish to start using the flow, you can click the Save button to save the latest changes. If there’s any missing or incorrect connection between nodes, a prompt will appear on the right side, listing all the occurring issue (misconfiguration inside each node won’t be detected here).  
Once all the issues have been addressed, the Admin shall click on the ‘Make Live’ button to activate a flow in Working Draft status. A new pop-up will appear: select or modify the Application that will be triggering this flow, optionally add comments, and click ‘Make Live’.  
Once a flow is set to go live, it will take approx. 2 minute before showing the correct ‘LIVE’ status on the top-left. In the meantime, it will show the ‘Publishing’ status, meaning that any messages received in the meantime will either be handled through the previous flow version or be rejected if no previous version is available.

## Introduction

#### Lab Objective

This lab is designed to introduce the Bot Builder interface, which is used for the configuration and orchestration Bots within Connect. In this lab you will not find configuration steps, the goal is to understand the purpose and use of each menu item.

#### Pre-requisites

1.  Connect URL for browser access.
2.  Admin credentials to login to Connect administration portal.

## 1. Understanding Connect Bots

Bot Builder is a cloud-based bot platform that allows enterprises to create bots. It includes Bot creation, testing, hosting, analyzing, and editing capabilities. The key features of Bot Builder include:

- Rules for handling flows
- Ability to retain context
- Omni-channel deployment
- Live agent handover
- Bot orchestration framework
- One-click bot testing
- Integration with business systems
- Enterprise-grade data security and privacy
- Analytics
- Custom reports

There are three types of Bots that can be integrated within a Connect flow:

- **Q&A Bots** – are knowledge-driven bots whose knowledge base consists of a series of possible questions (with their alternative syntax) and related answers.
- **Task Bots** – enable multi-turn conversations where a bot can obtain relevant data from users to perform the task at hand.
- **NLP Pipelines** – is a solution to build customized bots by defining the desired behaviors, without using the features already provided by Q&A and Task bots.

## 2. Access and navigation

Bot Builder is a dedicated portal which can be accessed via Connect:

- Access your Connect tenant
- Navigate to App Tray > Bot Builder

The interface, similarly to Connect, is divided in two main parts: the main menu on the left side and the configuration of the selected object in the center-right side.  
Move your mouse pointer on each icon of the menu to see its name and the available options:

- Dashboard – On the dashboard, the admin can review or create bots, which are then represented by cards that have basic information visible on them. There are 3 sections for each type of bot, by selecting each of them the admin can create new ones as the “+ New” button will update accordingly.
- Analytics – this section allows the administrator to collect and review statistics over bots utilization and performances. It’s a powerful tool to obtain an holistic view about volume and efficiency of configured bots.
- Help – the help icon will automatically open a new browser tab and redirect the admin to [https://help.imiconnect.io/](https://help.imiconnect.io/). On the home page scroll down until the ‘APP TRAY’ section and select ‘Bot Builder’ to read an in-depth explanation for all features and functionalities that bots can offer.

## 3. Understand and navigate Q&A Bots

First let’s start reviewing the interface as a new Q&A Bot gets created:

- Access your Connect tenant
- Navigate to App Tray > Bot Builder
- From the Dashboard > Select ‘Q&A bots’ > Click on ‘+ New Q&A Bot’
- Enter the Name and the Unique Name following your desired naming convention
- Select the text orientation as how the chat interface (within the Bot Builder) will position the text.
- \[OPTIONAL\] Toggle the option ‘Allow feedback’ to allow users to give a ‘thumb up’ or ‘thumb down’ to the answers the bot will prompt when consulted
- \[OPTIONAL\] Toggle the option ‘Allow agent handover’ to allow this bot to stop processing the incoming messages and handover the conversation to a different branch in your Connect flow.
- Click on ‘Done’ button to save and create the Q&A Bot.

Once opening a Q&A Bot a dedicated option menu appears on the left side and additional options on top

#### 3.1 Settings

- Profile – in this section the admin can change the bot name, its description and the text alignment.
- Management – in this section the admin can change the Bot status and disable it (without deleting it) and change the ‘Allow Feedback’ option set when it was created.
- Handover – in this section the admin can change the ‘Allow agent handover’ option set when the bot was created, and change specific handover options.

#### 3.2 Articles

Articles are containers of questions (in their possible variations), for which the answer to be provided will be the same. The questions are called ‘Utterances’. Here the key information about Articles:

- When creating a new Article the admin must provide a Default Utterance, which will be then displayed as ‘Title’ in the list. Then add possible alternative containing different key words and phrases the system will then use to recognize and match what will be provided by the user.
- Articles contain both the question (and its alternatives) and the related answer.
- Admin can create Categories and assign articles to them, so to have better control of existing configuration.
- When editing an Article, the admin can also edit the response (text, format and conditions).
- After any changes, the Q&A bot needs to be ‘Trained’ first, and then moved to ‘Live’.

> Any new Q&A bot will be created with a default Articles list.

**3.3 Testing**

Bot Builder platform provides a built-in one-click bot testing framework that is extremely helpful in testing a large set of test cases easily and quickly. It helps to validate the use cases listed will trigger the expected behaviour.

#### 3.4 Curation

Curation console helps users in optimizing their bot's performance over time through human-in-the-loop learning. It facilitates users in reviewing cases where their bot performance was underwhelming. These can be curated to improve current articles/intents or to create new articles/intents

#### 3.5 Session

Displays the history of all sessions established with the customers. Each session is displayed as a record that contains all sent/received messages. Messages from a specific session or from multiples sessions can be downloaded as CSV file. Reviewing sessions in detail is extremely useful to audit, analyse, and improve the bot performances and customer satisfaction.

#### 3.6 History

Provide version control over all changes the administrator applies on that specific bot. Any admin can review which changes were applied on specific version and revert to previous ones where needed.

## 4. Understand and navigate Task Bots

First let’s start reviewing the interface as a new Q&A Bot gets created:

- Access your Connect tenant.
- Navigate to App Tray > Bot Builder.
- From the Dashboard > Select ‘Task bots’ > Click on ‘+ New Task Bot’.
- Enter the Name and the Unique Name following your desired naming convention
- Select the text orientation as how the chat interface (within the Bot Builder) will position the text.
- \[OPTIONAL\] Toggle the option ‘Allow feedback’ to allow users to give a ‘thumb up’ or ‘thumb down’ to the answers the bot will prompt when consulted.
- Click on ‘Done’ button to save and create the Q&A Bot.

Once opening a Task Bot a dedicated option menu appears on the left side and additional options on top

#### 4.1 Settings

- Profile – in this section the admin can change the bot name, its description and the text alignment.
- Management – in this section the admin can change the Bot status and disable it (without deleting it) and change the ‘Allow Feedback’ option set when it was created.
- Handover – in this section the admin can change the ‘Allow agent handover’ option set when the bot was created, and change specific handover options.

#### 4.2 Training

Similar to articles, the Training section allows the admin to define containers for customer queries, called Intents, and to identify specific words in those messages with objects called Entities. Here the key information about Articles:

- Entities only contain the questions and they are mapped to the desired response. The response is defined separately.
- The admin will first need to define the desired Entities with the desired type (List, Time, Date, etc.).
- The Intent Name is just descriptive. The list of messages coming from the customer, and alternatives, will be listed under Utterances.
- When creating the Intent (adding the desired Utterances), the system will automatically recognize the specific words and map them to the respective Entity.
- In case any word is not automatically mapped, the admin can select the desired text in an Utterance and manually map it to an Entity
- Any Entity that is mapped in the defined Utterances will be listed inside the Slots section. This allows to trigger specific actions for each Entities before the bot provides the desired Response for that Intent.
- Entities can be used across multiple Intents, and their value can be stored and used in the Responses.
- After any changes in the Training section, the Training bot needs to be ‘Trained’ first, and then moved to ‘Live’.

#### 4.3 Responses

Answers for the Intents specified inside the Training section are defined within the respective Templates. Here the key information about Responses:

- The layouts of each response within the Templates can be edited (text, format and conditions).
- Different responses, depending on the used channel, can be defined within the same template.
- Conditions can be configured so to trigger a different response following predefined criteria
- After any changes in the Response section, the Training bot needs to be ‘Updated’ first, and then moved to ‘Live’.
- The Agent Handover Response template it’s the default response that allows the Task Bot Node inside the Connect Flow Designer to escalate the chat through a different route.

#### 4.4 Testing

Bot Builder platform provides a built-in one-click bot testing framework that is extremely helpful in testing a large set of test cases easily and quickly. It helps to validate the use cases listed will trigger the expected behaviour.

#### 4.5 Curation

Curation console helps users in optimizing their bot's performance over time through human-in-the-loop learning. It facilitates users in reviewing cases where their bot performance was underwhelming. These can be curated to improve current articles/intents or to create new articles/intents

#### 4.6 Session

Displays the history of all sessions established with the customers. Each session is displayed as a record that contains all sent/received messages. Messages from a specific session or from multiples sessions can be downloaded as CSV file. Reviewing sessions in detail is extremely useful to audit, analyse, and improve the bot performances and customer satisfaction.

#### 4.7 History

Provide version control over all changes the administrator applies on that specific bot. Any admin can review which changes were applied on specific version and revert to previous ones where needed.

## 1. Create a new Task Bot

- Access your Connect tenant
- Navigate to App Tray > Bot Builder
- From the Dashboard > Select ‘Q&A bots’ > Click on ‘+ New Q&A Bot’
- Enter the Name and the Unique Name following your desired naming convention
- Leave the other settings as they are.
- Click on ‘Done’ button to save and create the Q&A Bot.
- Select Training > click on Entities > click on ‘+ Create entity’
- Provide a Name and select the respective Entity Type in the list > Click on Save
- Repeat the step above for as many intent you wish to add
- Select Training > click on Intents > click on ‘+ Create Intent’
- Insert a descriptive Intent Name
- Insert the utterances in the way you expect the customer to message your bot, including words you defined inside the Entities
	- When adding utterances with Entities, those will be automatically highlighted and will appear in the Slot section
	- You can decide to make Entities mandatory by selecting the respective checkbox. By doing so you will need to set the number of times the bot will keep asking for that value (Retries). The bot will ask for it using the corresponding Template Key (in the Responses).
	- When using Entities it is recommended to add at least 3 alternative Utterances containing them.
- Select the Response which will be prompted as final message when all the required Entities will be collected. You can select ‘+ Create New’ at the bottom of the list to create a new dedicated response.
	- When typing the response text, the syntax \${} will allow the admin to use system variables as part of the text to be presented as response to the customer. Use \${entity.YOURENTITYNAME} to use the value stored in an existing entity. It is recommended to use this only for Entities which are set as Required in the Intents to avoid empty messages being provided to customers.
- Click on Save (top-right) > Click on the ‘backward arrow’ (top-left) to return to the Training menu > Click on Train (top-right) > Leave a comment (mandatory) > Click on Continue > Click on Make Live (top-right) > Leave a comment (optional) > Click on Make Live.
- \[OPTIONAL\] Click on Preview (top-right) > In the chat widget that will appear you can start testing your bot by chatting with it.

## 2. Add the Task Bot to your flow

The recommendation in the Connect flow designer is to create a loop on the Task Bot node where any input from the customer will be received and answered by the bot. The loop can be interrupted either by checking the bot response through a Branch node (so to create different paths based on the responses) or when the bot itself will determine the Agent Handover condition. A Task Bot node can also be used without creating a loop, meaning that after the first execution the admin will need to define static subsequent actions. The Task Bot node should be added only after the Create/Re-open Conversation ID and Task nodes. For any nodes in the loop, the admin needs to ensure the Timeout and Failure Outcomes will be pointed to a Close Conversation and Close Task nodes.

- Access your Connect tenant.
- Navigate to Service > Select and open your existing working service.
- Click on Edit (top-right).
- Navigate to Settings > Custom Variables > Create a new Custom Variable and name it BotInputMessage.
- Edit the Incoming Message (first node) > select Transition Actions > in Action 1 section select ‘+ Add’ > select BotInputMessage > assign the value $(n2.messenger.message) > Save
- Create some space between the Create Conversation node and the next by moving the subsequent nodes > Remove the Successful Outcome link (green) coming out the Create Conversation node.
- From the node menu (left) select the Task Bot node and drag it in the flo
- Connect the Create Conversation node from the Successful Outcome to the Task Bot node
- Edit the Task Bot node
	- From the BOT drop-down menu select the Bot name we previously created
	- In the message field enter $(BotInputMessage)
	- From the channel drop-down menu select the channel this flow is using
	- In the PS ID field enter $(n2.messenger.psId)
	- Save the node configuratiom
- Connect the Timeout and Failure Outcomes from the Task not node to the Close Conversation node
- From the node menu (left) select the Channel node (depending on the channel in use in the flow, i.e. SMS) and drag it in the flow
- Connect the Task Bot node from the Successful Outcome to the Channel node > a pop-up window will appear > select OnSuccess and click OK
- Edit the Channel node
	- Copy the configuration from another pre-existing Channel node in the flow
	- In the Message field enter $(nX.taskbot.text_response) (replace the X with the node ID from the Task Bot node)
	- Save the node configuration
- Connect the Failure Outcomes from the Channel node to the Close Conversation node
- From the node menu (left) select the Branch node and drag it in the flow
- Connect the Channel node from the Successful Outcome to the Branch node
- Edit the Branch node
	- In the Branch 1 VARIABLE field enter $(nX.taskbot.text_response) (replace the X with the node ID from the Task Bot node).
	- From the Condition drop-down menu select ‘Equals’.
	- In the VALUE field enter the same text defines in the Goodbye Response Template from the Bot Builder (customize it if needed).
	- Save the node configuration.
- Connect the Failure Outcomes from Branch node to the Close Conversation node > Connect the Successful Outcomes to the Close Conversation node > a pop-up window will appear > select Branch 1 and click OK.
- From the node menu (left) select the Receive node and drag it in the flow
- Edit the Receive node
	-  In the SELECT INCOMING MESSAGE/EVENT list select the option corresponding to your channel.
	- Edit the MAX TIMEOUT with the preferred duration (in seconds) for the time the flow will allow the customer to add a response (i.e. 120)
	- Enter the corresponding ID for your channel.
	- From the EVENT NAME drop-down menu select ‘Incoming Message’.
	- Click on Transaction Actions
		- Click on ‘+ Add Action’.
		- in TIME select On-leave.
		- Action – Set Variable.
		- Variable – BotInputMessage.
		- Value – $(nX.receive.message) (replace the X with the node ID from this Receive node).
	- Save the node configuration
- Connect the Failure Outcomes from the Receive node to the Close Conversation node > Connect the Successful Outcomes back to the Task Bot node
- From the node menu (left) select the Channel node and drag it in the flow
- Edit the Channel node
	- Copy the configuration from another pre-existing Channel node in the flow
	- From the MESSAGE TYPE drop-down menu select ‘Text’.
	- In the Message field enter the following message “Sorry we didn’t hear back from you, please contact us again later”.
	- Save the node configuration.
- Connect all Failure and Successful Outcomes from the Messenger node to the Close Conversation node.
- From the node menu (left) select the Channel node and drag it in the flow
- Edit the Channel node
	- Copy the configuration from another pre-existing Channel node in the flow.
	- From the MESSAGE TYPE drop-down menu select ‘Text’.
	- In the Message field enter $(nX.taskbot.text_response) (replace the X with the node ID from the Task Bot node).
	- Save the node configuration.
- Connect the Failure Outcomes from the Messenger node to the Close Conversation node > Connect the Successful Outcome from the Task Bot node to the Messenger node (the ‘onAgentHandover’ outcome event will be automatically selected)
- From the node menu (left) select the Append Conversation node and drag it in the flow.
- Edit the Append Conversation node
	- METHOD NAME = Append.
	- NODE RUNTIME AUTH = Select your predefined authorization.
	- CHANNEL = Select the channel in use.
	- CONVERSATION ID = $(conversationId)
	- DIRECTION –Inbound
	- TEXT = enter $(nX.taskbot.text_response) (replace the X with the node ID from the Task Bot node).
	- TIMESTAMP = $(n2.messenger.ts)
	- ATTACHMENTS = $(parseDataAttachment)
	- Save the node configuration
- Connect the Timeout and Failure Outcomes from the Append Conversation node to the Close Conversation node > Connect the Successful Outcome to the Create Task node.
- Connect the Successful Outcome of the Channel node to the Append Conversation node.
- Save and publish the flow (Make Live).

> In this lab, when the conversation is escalated to the agent, the agent will only receive the last response from the Bot to the customer, and for this reason earlier we recommended to add the Entities’ values in the Agent Handover Response (so the agent can understand which values where entered and will not have to ask for them again). If you prefer to provide the entire transcript of all messages exchanged between customer and Bot, you will need to add an Append Conversation node after each Channel and Receive node.

## 3. Testing

Time to test your new configuration:

- Access the agent desktop using your test agent credentials.
- Using the preferred channel, send a message in.
- Continue your conversation with the bot and provide the Entities you defined.
- Get your conversation escalated to the agent.
- Have your agent conversating with the customer.

## 1. Introduction to Event Scheduler

Event Scheduler allows Webex Connect users to send SMS messages or schedule execution of Webex Connect rules/live flows, by uploading a file (on the UI or via an SFTP location) with required information in the relevant format. From Webex Connect select the App Tray & then click on Event Scheduler (Event Scheduler will open in a new browser tab).

The Event Scheduler page gives access to:
- Scheduler – to create new or manage existing scheduled tasks
- Logs – to review all trigger executions in the last 6 months

## Introduction

#### Lab Objective

This section is designed to introduce troubleshooting capabilities available for digital channels in Webex Connect platform. In addition there examples of the most common issues and the ways of how to fix them.

#### Pre-requisite

1. You received Webex CC Management Portal, Agent Desktop and Webex Connect URL .
2. You have admin credentials for Webex CC Management Portal and Engage Portal.
3. You have admin credentials for Connect Portal.
4. You have at least one flow created and published in Webex Connect.


## 1. Understanding of Webex Connect troubleshooting capabilities

>**Note:** Please check and make sure all configuration steps for digital channel have been completed successfully before start troubleshooting it.

There are the following troubleshooting capabilities available for the administrator to troubleshoot issues in digital channels provided by Webex Connect:
-  Export Logs tool
-  The debugger built into the flow builder
Let's consider how we can use both of them.

#### 1.1. Export Logs tool

This tool allows Webex Connect admin to download inbound and outbound log events as XLSX file for any Service / Asset / Digital Channel for desired timeframe. The we can inspect this file to check, for example, whether the message was received or sent by corresponding component of Webex Connect platform.

Please login to Connect Portal, then go to ***Tools*** -> ***Export Logs*** to access the tool.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Export_Logs_1](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Export_Logs_1.png)

Let's download all incoming messages received via ***Chat_Asset*** for the last 7 days. We need to provide the following details and press ***Download*** button:

| Parameter Name | Parameter Value  |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Number or App  | Chat_asset       |
| Channel Event  | Incoming Message |
| Period         | Last 7 days      |

![DC_Lab.12.19_Export_Logs_2](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Export_Logs_2.png)

After the log file has been downloaded, we can open the file and see all inbound events, including timestamps, IDs and message text. We can use the file to check whether specific message rom the end user has been received by Webex Connect via selected Number or App (asset).

![DC_Lab.12.19_Export_Logs_3](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Export_Logs_3.png)

Now, let's download all outbound messages for ***My First Service*** for the last 7 days. We need to provide the following details and press ***Download*** button:

| Parameter Name | Parameter Value              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Service        | My First Sertvice            |
| Channel        | Live Chat / In-App Messaging |
| Period         | Last 7 days                  |

![DC_Lab.12.19_Export_Logs_4](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Export_Logs_4.png)

After the log file has been downloaded, we can open the file and see all outbound events, incliding timestamps, IDs and message text. We can use this log to check whether exact message has been sent to the end user by Webex Connect via selected Service / Channel.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Export_Logs_5](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Export_Logs_5.png)

#### 1.2. Flow Debugger 

This tool allows Webex Connect admin to track flow execution from the beginning till the end. Flow debugger has the following capabilities:
-  search for exact flow execution event based on the timestamp or Transaction ID
-  briefly shows the result of exectuting each node of the flow in the form of a list
-  adds unique ID to each node on flow canvas to simplify the mapping between the nodes and items in the list
-  shows all the parameters used when calling each flow node
-  shows the responce returned by each flow node after it had been called
-  shows the values of the variables created by admin for troubleshooting purpose

>**Note:** By default, debugging details are encrypted in Flow Debugger. Webex Connect admin account should have ***Decryption Access*** permission to be able to decrypt the details.
>- Admin account with ***Owner*** permission has ***Decryption Access*** by default.
>- Admin accoun without ***Owner*** permission has no ***Decryption Access*** by default - it can be granted by the owner.

Login to Connect Portal and go to ***Settings*** -> ***Teammates*** and loot at ***Decryption Access*** column to check which accounts on Connect Portal have log decryption permission. For example:

![DC_Lab.12.19_Flow_Debugger_1](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Flow_Debugger_1.png)

To grant ***Decryption Access*** permission to some admin account, check and make sure you are logged in under admin account with ***Owner*** permission. Then click ***Edit*** button next to the desired admin account, tick ***Decrypt Logs*** check box in the pop-up window with account details and save changes.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Flow_Debugger_2](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Flow_Debugger_2.png)

Check and make sure ***Decryption Access*** permission is visible next to the desired admin account in the list of users.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Flow_Debugger_3](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Flow_Debugger_3.png)


## 2. Debugging a flow

Flow debugger is embedded into Webex Connect flow builedr. Let's have a look how to use it. 

-  Login to Connect Portal and go to ***Services***. Then go to the service, switch to ***Flows*** tab and double-click on the flow which you are going to debug. 
-  Once the flow is loaded, click on ***Debug*** button on the right pane. Flow debugger window will
appear at the bottom. This window is scalable, so we can adjust its size to make troublehooting process more convenient.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Debugging_Flow_1](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Debugging_Flow_1.png)

-  Provide proper time frame or ***Transaction ID*** (if you know it) and press ***Search*** button to find corresponding flow events. You will see all found flow events as a list in debugger window. Each line of the list represents single flow execution.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Debugging_Flow_2](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Debugging_Flow_2.png)

-  Click on the corresponding hyperlink in ***Transaction ID*** column to see the details of exact flow execution. Those details will be displayed as a list at a separate tab in the same debugger window. The title of the tab will be the value of the Transaction ID.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Debugging_Flow_3](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Debugging_Flow_3.png)

-  Select one item from the list to see its details on the right-hand side of debugging window. All details of the event are encrypted by default. Click on ***DECRYPT LOGS*** button in the title of debuggin screen to see decrypted log messages.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Debugging_Flow_4](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Debugging_Flow_4.png)

-  Decrypted log messages will be displayed on the right-hand side of debuggin window. Those log messages include the parameters used when calling the node as well as the results returned by the node after the request was processed. You can copy the value of any debug message by pressing copy icon next to the message on the right-hand side of debugging window.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Debugging_Flow_5](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Debugging_Flow_5.png)

-  All items in the list have ***Node ID*** and ***Node*** which matches the same values for each node on flow canvas.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Debugging_Flow_6](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Debugging_Flow_6.png)

-  So, every time you click on any item in the list in debugging window the log messages of this node are displayed on the righ-hand side. In addition, corresponding node is highlighted with a blue border on flow canvas, which simplifies troubleshhoting.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Debugging_Flow_8](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Debugging_Flow_8.png)

In the next section we will look at the most common issues in Webex Connect flows and how to solve them.


## 3. The most common issues in Webex Connect flows

Let's look at few examples of the most commn issues in Webex Connect flows. We will consider how to identify the cause of each issue and potential solutions. 

#### 3.1. Engage Asset not linked to Entry Point in Webex CC

Here is an example of what will happen if live chat app (asset) is not assigned to the Entry Point on Webex CC management portal. Flow debugger disaplays ***onInvalidChoice*** error next to the affected ***Create Task*** node. The error on the right-hand side of debugging window contains ***desc : no valid edge found for the async event*** message.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_No_EP_1](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_No_EP_1.png)

Please follow the action plan below to fox the issue:
1. Please check which app/asset is assigned to the affected flow on Connect Portal.
2. Login to Webex CC Management Portal, go to ***Provisioning*** -> ***Etry Points/Queues*** -> ***Entry Point*** and select ***Edit*** next to the proper Entry Point.
3. Then select affected app/asset created on Connect Portal in the ***Asset Name*** drop-down list and save changes. If the affected asset is not in the drop-down list, please create new one on Connect portal, register it with proper service and check one more time.


#### 3.2. Engage authorization not working

Here is an example where Webex CC authorization does not work properly. Flow debugger disaplays ***onInvalidData*** error next to the affected Engage node.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_Engage_Auth_1](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_Engage_Auth_1.png)

The error ***desc : Authorization not found*** means the autorization configured in ***NODE RUNTIME AUTHORIZATION*** field of ***Search Conversation*** node does not work.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_Engage_Auth_2](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_Engage_Auth_2.png)

Potential ways to fix the issue:

1. If there is ***undefined*** value of autorization selected in ***NODE RUNTIME AUTHORIZATION*** field of the affected node, this means that Engage autorization used for this node has been deleted. Please select another autorization from the drop-down list or create new authorization, then save changes and make the flow live.

3. If there is incorrect autorization selected in ***NODE RUNTIME AUTHORIZATION*** field of the affected node, please select proper value from the drop-down list, save changes and make the flow live.

2. If correct autorization is selected in ***NODE RUNTIME AUTHORIZATION*** field of the affected node, but it fails, please update selected authorization. Go to ***Assets*** -> ***Integrations*** -> ***Webex CC Engage*** and select ***Manage*** from the drop-down list next to the integartion name. For example:

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_Engage_Auth_3](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_Engage_Auth_3.png)

Then scroll down to ***Node Authorizations***, click on arrow button to expand the list and select ***Update*** from ***Actions*** list next to the affected authorization.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_Engage_Auth_4](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_Engage_Auth_4.png)

Then click on ***Authorize*** button in the pop-up window and provide credentials if needed to update Webex CC authorization.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_Engage_Auth_5](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_Engage_Auth_5.png)


#### 3.3. Webex CC authorization not working

Here is an example where Webex CC authorization does not work properly. Flow debugger disaplays ***onauthorizationfail*** error next to the affected Webex CC node.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_WebexCC_Auth_1](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_WebexCC_Auth_1.png)

The error ***desc : unauthorized, integration :Create Task, method : Create Task*** means the autorization configured in ***NODE RUNTIME AUTHORIZATION*** field of ***Create Task*** node does not work.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_WebexCC_Auth_2](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_WebexCC_Auth_2.png)

Potential ways to fix the issue:

1. If there is incorrect autorization selected in ***NODE RUNTIME AUTHORIZATION*** field of the affected node, please select proper value from the drop-down list, save changes and make the flow live.

2. If correct autorization is selected in ***NODE RUNTIME AUTHORIZATION*** field of the affected node, but it fails, please make sure proper account is still active on Control Hub. Then go to ***Assets*** -> ***Integrations*** -> ***Webex CC Task*** and select ***Manage*** from the drop-down list next to the integartion name. For example:

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_WebexCC_Auth_3](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_WebexCC_Auth_3.png)

Then scroll down to ***Node Authorizations***, click on arrow button to expand the list and select ***Update*** from ***Actions*** list next to the affected authorization.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_WebexCC_Auth_4](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_WebexCC_Auth_4.png)

Then click on ***Authorize*** button in the pop-up window and provide credentials if needed to update Webex CC authorization.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_WebexCC_Auth_5](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_WebexCC_Auth_5.png)


#### 3.4. Variable does not exist or has an empty value

Here is an example where the variable assigned to one of the parameters of flow node does not exist or has empty value. Flow debugger disaplays ***onError*** error next to the affected ***Create Task*** node.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_No_Value_1](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_No_Value_1.png)

The error ***desc : value is mandatory , name : task id*** means ***TASK ID*** parameter of ***Create Task*** node had no value when the node was executed. It could happen if the variable assigned to ***TASK ID*** did not exist or had an empty value. 
To fix this issue, we need to open the configuration of ***Cretae Task*** node and check the value of ***TASK ID*** parameter. In our case there is a variable ***$(flid_na)***, which does not exist and that's why there was an empty value used when calling ***Create Task*** node. 

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_No_Value_2](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_No_Value_2.png)

Potential ways to fix the issue:
1. Correct variable name if it is wrong and check the value of this variable
2. Create a variable if it does not exist and assign proper value to it
3. \[Not a flexible approach\] Replace the variable name by exact value


#### 3.5. Variable or parameter has wrong value

Here is an example where the variable or parameter of a flow node has wrong value. Flow debugger disaplays ***onAppendMessageFailure*** error next to the affected ***Append Conversation*** node.

![DC_Lab.12.19_Error_Wrong_Value_1](/assets/images/DC_Lab_12.19._Error_Wrong_Value_1.png)

The error ***""description":"Chat ID provided does not exist","event":"conversation-message:error","value":{"conversationId":"this-is-wrong-ID-just-for-example","aliasId":""}"*** means that ***CONVERSATION ID*** parameter of ***Append Conversation*** node has wrong value - ***"this-is-wrong-ID-just-for-example"***. Please double-click on the affected node and correct the value of ***CONVERSATION ID*** parameter to fix the issue. Then save changes and make the flow live.

## Introduction

#### Lab Objective

This lab walks through the configuration of Global and Flow variables for digital channels. The behavior of these variables are the same as how they would work for telephony flows. Global variables are centrally configured and reported in WxCC and they are fetch via flows in Webex Connect. Flow variables are configured locally within Webex Connect flows and are not reportable.

Both variables are transferable between flows. In the second part of this lab in 12.24.3, we will configure the transfer of chat form entries received in the inbound chat flow to routed flow when agent accepts the inbound chat.

#### Pre-requisite

-   Admin credentials to login to WxCC and Webex Connect portal
-   Working inbound chat and routed flow
-   Knowledge of WxCC Global variables and Analyzer

        var object = responseArray[i];

        if (object.name == varname) {

            return object.value;

        }
    }
}
